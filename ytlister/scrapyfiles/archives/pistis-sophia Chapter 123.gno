 Pistis Sophia
translated by G. S. R. MeadMary continued again and said unto the Saviour: "My Lord, a man who hath received mysteries and hath not done what is worthy ofp. 260them, but he hath turned and hath sinned, thereafter he hath again repented and hath been in great repentance,--is it then lawful for my brethren to renew for him the mystery which he hath received, or |314. rather give him a mystery out of the lower mysteries,--is it lawful, or not?"In the case of repentance only higher mysteries than those previously received can remit sins.The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "Amēn, amēn, I say unto you: Neither the mystery which he hath received, nor the lower hearken unto him, to forgive his sins; but it is the mysteries which are higher than those which he hath received, which hearken unto him and forgive his sins. Now, therefore, Mary, let thy brethren give him the mystery which is higher than that which he hath received, and they are to accept his repentance from him and forgive his sins,--the latter indeed, because he hath received it once more, and the former, because he hath towered over them [the lower mysteries] upward,--the latter indeed hearkeneth not unto him to forgive his sin; but it is the mystery which is higher than that which he hath received, that forgiveth his sins. But if on the other hand he hath received the three mysteries in the two spaces or in the third from within, and he hath turned and transgressed, no mystery hearkeneth unto him to help him in his repentance, neither the higher nor the lower, save the mystery of the First Mystery and the mysteries of the Ineffable,--it is they which hearken unto him and accept his repentance from him."Mary answered and said: "My Lord, a man who hath received mysteries up to two or three |315. in the second or third space, and he hath not transgressed, but is still in his faith in uprightnessp. 261and without play-acting, [what will befall him]?"There is no limit to the number of mysteries the faithful may receive.And the Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "Every man who hath received mysteries in the second and in the third space, and hath not transgressed, but is still in his faith without play-acting, it is lawful for such an one to receive mysteries in the space which pleaseth him, from the first to the last, because they have not transgressed."Return to the Gnostic Society Library
