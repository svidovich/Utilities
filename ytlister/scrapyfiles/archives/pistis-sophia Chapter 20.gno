 Pistis Sophia
translated by G. S. R. MeadShe said: "My Lord, will all the men who know the mystery of the magic of all the rulers of all the æons of the Fate and of those of the sphere, in the way in which the angels who transgressedp. 23have taught them, if they invoke them in their mysteries, that is in their evil magic, to the hindering of good deeds,--will they accomplish them henceforth from now on or not?"Jesus explaineth further the conversion of the spheres.Jesus answered and said unto Mary: "They will not accomplish them as they accomplished them from the beginning, because I have taken away a third of their power; but they will raise a loan from those who know the mysteries of the magic of the thirteenth æon. And if they invoke the mysteries of the magic of those who are in the thirteenth æon, |30. they will accomplish them well and surely, because I have not taken away power from that region, according to the command of the First Mystery."Return to the Gnostic Society Library
