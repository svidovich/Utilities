 Pistis Sophia
translated by G. S. R. MeadAnd he continued again in the discourse and said unto the disciples: "These are all adventures which have befallen Pistis Sophia. |166. It came to pass then, when I had led her to the region which is below the thirteenth Ã¦on, and wasp. 140about to go unto the Light and depart from her, that she said unto me:The conversation of Sophia and the Light."'O Light of lights, thou wilt go to the Light and depart from me. And Tyrant Adamas will know that thou hast departed from me and will know that my saviour is not at hand. And he will come again to this region, he and all his rulers who hate me, and Self-willed also will bestow power unto his lion-faced emanation, so that they all will come and constrain me all together and take my whole light from me, in order that I may become powerless and again without light. Now, therefore, O Light and my Light, take from them the power of their light, so that they may not be able to constrain me from now on.'The Light promiseth to seal the regions of Self-willed."It came to pass then, when I heard these words which Pistis Sophia had spoken unto me, that I answered her, saying: 'My Father, who hath emanated me, hath not yet given me commandment to take their light from them; but I will seal the regions of Self-willed and of all his rulers who hate thee because thou hast had faith in the Light. And I will also seal the regions of Adamas and of his rulers, so that none of them may be able to fight with thee, until their time is completed and the season cometh that my Father give me commandment to take their light from them.'Return to the Gnostic Society Library
