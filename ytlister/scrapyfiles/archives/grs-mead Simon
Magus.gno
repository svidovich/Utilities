      Peter, the apostle, rebuked him, as told in the narrative of the Acts 
      of the Apostles. Many also have heard the legend of how at Rome this 
      wicked sorcerer endeavoured to fly by aid of the demons, and how Peter 
      caused him to fall headlong and thus miserably perish. And so most think 
      that there is an end of the matter, and either cast their mite of pity or 
      contempt at the memory of Simon, or laugh at the whole matter as the 
      invention of superstition or the imagination of religious fanaticism, 
      according as their respective beliefs may be in orthodoxy or materialism. 
      This for the general. Students of theology and church history, on the 
      other hand, have had a more difficult task set them in comparing and 
      arranging the materials they have at their disposal, as found in the 
      patristic writings and legendary records; and various theories have been 
      put forward, not the least astonishing being the supposition that Simon 
      was an alias for Paul, and that the Simon and Peter in the accounts of the 
      fathers and in the narrative of the legends were simply concrete symbols 
      to represent the two sides of the Pauline and Petrine controversies.The first reason why I have ventured on this present enquiry is that 
      Simon Magus is invariably mentioned by the heresiologists as the founder 
      of the first heresy of the commonly-accepted Christian era, and is 
      believed by them to have been the originator of those systems of religio-philosophy 
      and theosophy which are now somewhat inaccurately classed together under 
      the heading of Gnosticism. And though this assumption of the patristic 
      heresiologists is entirely incorrect, as may be proved from their own 
      works, it is nevertheless true that Simonianism is the first system that, 
      as far as our present records go, came into conflict with what has been 
      regarded as the orthodox stream of Christianity. A second reason is that I 
      believe that Simon has been grossly misrepresented, and entirely 
      misunderstood, by his orthodox opponents, whoever they were, in the first 
      place, and also, in the second place, by those who have ignorantly and 
      without enquiry copied from them. But my chief reason is that the present 
      revival of theosophical enquiry throws a flood of light on Simon's 
      teachings, whenever we can get anything approaching a first-hand statement 
      of them, and shows that it was identical in its fundamentals with the 
      Esoteric Philosophy of all the great religions of the world.In this enquiry, I shall have to be slightly wearisome to some of my 
      readers, for instead of giving a selection or even a paraphraze of the 
      notices on Simon which we have from authenticated patristic sources, I 
      shall furnish verbatim translations, and present a digest only of the 
      unauthenticated legends. The growth of the Simonian legend must unfold 
      itself before the reader in its native form as it comes from the pens of 
      those who have constructed it. Repetitions will, therefore, be unavoidable 
      in the marshalling of authorities, but they will be shown to be not 
      without interest in the subsequent treatment of the subject, and at any 
      rate we shall at least be on the sure ground of having before us all that 
      has been said on the matter by the Church fathers. Having cited these 
      authorities, I shall attempt to submit them to a critical examination, and 
      so eliminate all accretions, hearsay and controversial opinions, and thus 
      sift out what reliable residue is possible. Finally, my task will be to 
      show that Simon taught a system of Theosophy, which instead of deserving 
      our condemnation should rather excite our admiration, and that, instead of 
      being a common impostor and impious perverter of public morality, his 
      method was in many respects of the same nature as the methods of the 
      theosophical movement of to-day, and deserves the study and consideration 
      of all students of Theosophy.
      
      This essay will, therefore, be divided into the following parts:

      originals are lost, and the Latin translation of Rufinus (born c.A.D. 345, 
      died 410) alone remains to us. The originals are placed by conjecture 
      somewhere about the beginning of the third century; MS. eleventh century.B. A mediæval account; (Constitutiones Sanctorum Apostolorum, 
      VI. vii, viii, xvi); these were never heard of prior to 1546, when a

      an MS. found in Crete. They are hopelessly apocryphal. Acts (viii. 9-24). Text: The Greek Testament (with the 
      readings adopted by the revisers of the authorized version); Oxford, 1881.And the apostles in Jerusalem hearing that Samaria 
        had received the Word of God, sent Peter and John to them. And they went 
        down and prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit. For 
        as yet it had not fallen upon any of them, but they had only been 
        baptized unto the Name of the Lord Jesus.Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy 
        Spirit. And when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given by the laying 
        on of the hands of the apostles, he offered them money, saying: "Give 
        unto me also this power, in order that on whomsoever I lay my hands he 
        may receive the Holy Spirit."But Peter said unto him: "Thy silver perish with thee, in that thou 
        didst think that the gift of God is possessed with money. There is not 
        for thee part or lot in this Word, for thy heart is not right before 
        God. Therefore turn from this evil of thine, and pray the Lord, if by 
        chance the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee. For I see that 
        thou art in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity."And Simon answered and said: "Pray ye on my behalf to the Lord, that 
        none of the things that ye have said may come upon me."

        refused to believe in God, he ambitiously strove to contend against the 
        apostles, so that he also might be thought of great renown, by extending 
        his investigations into universal magic still farther, so that he struck 
        many aghast; so much so that he is said to have been honoured with a 
        statue for his magic knowledge by Claudius Cæsar.He, therefore, was glorified by many as a god; and he taught that it 
        was he himself who, forsooth, appeared among the Jews as the Son, while 
        in Samaria he descended as the Father, and in the rest of the nations he 
        came as the Holy Spirit. That he was the highest power, to wit, the 
        Father over all, and that he allowed himself to be called by whatever 
        name men pleased.2. Now the sect of the Samaritan Simon, from whom all the heresies 
        took their origin, was composed of the following materials.He took round with him a certain Helen, a hired prostitute from the 
        Phoenician city Tyre, after he had purchased her freedom, saying that 
        she was the first conception (or Thought) of his Mind, the Mother of 
        All, by whom in the beginning he conceived in his Mind the making of the 
        Angels and Archangels. That this Thought, leaping forth from him, and 
        knowing what was the will of her Father, descended to the lower regions 
        and generated the Angels and Powers, by whom also he said this world was 
        made. And after she had generated them, she was detained by them through 
        envy, for they did not wish to be thought to be the progeny of any 
        other. As for himself, he was entirely unknown by them; and it was his 
        Thought that was made prisoner by the Powers and Angels that has been 
        emanated by her. And she suffered every kind of indignity at their 
        hands, to prevent her reäscending to her Father, even to being 
        imprisoned in the human body and transmigrating into other female 
        bodies, as from one vessel into another.[7] 
        She also was in that Helen, on whose account the Trojan War arose; 
        wherefore also Stesichorus[8] 
        was deprived of his sight when he spake evil of her in his poems; and 
        that afterwards when he repented and wrote what is called a recantation, 
        in which he sang her praises, he recovered his sight. So she, 
        transmigrating from body to body, and thereby also continually 
        undergoing indignity, last of all even stood for hire in a brothel; and 
        she was the "lost sheep."3. Wherefore also he himself had come, to take her away for the first 
        time, and free her from her bonds, and also to guarantee salvation to 
        men by his "knowledge." For as the Angels were mismanaging the world, 
        since each of them desired the sovereignty, he had come to set matters 
        right; and that he had descended, transforming himself and being made 
        like to the Powers and Principalities and Angels; so that he appeared to 
        men as a man, although he was not a man; and was thought to have 
        suffered in Judæa, although he did not really suffer. The Prophets 
        moreover had spoken their prophecies under the inspiration of the Angels 
        who made the world; wherefore those who believed on him and his Helen 
        paid no further attention to them, and followed their own pleasure as 
        though free; for men were saved by his grace, and not by righteous 
        works. For righteous actions are not according to nature, but from 
        accident, in the manner that the Angels who made the world have laid it 
        down, by such precepts enslaving men. Wherefore also he gave new 
        promises that the world should be dissolved and that they who were his 
        should be freed from the rule of those who made the world.4. Wherefore their initiated priests live immorally. And everyone of 
        them practises magic arts to the best of his ability. They use exorcisms 
        and incantations. Love philtres also and spells and what are called 
        "familiars" and "dream-senders," and the rest of the curious arts are 
        assiduously cultivated by them. They have also an image of Simon made in 
        the likeness of Jupiter, and of Helen in that of Minerva; and they 
        worship the (statues); and they have a designation from their most 
        impiously minded founder, being called Simonians, from whom the Gnôsis, 
        falsely so-called, derives its origins, as one can learn from their own 
        assertions.iii. Clemens Alexandrinus (Stromateis, ii. 11; vii. 17). Text:

        This Simon was skilled in magic, and deluding many, partly by the art of 
        Thrasymedes, in the way we have explained above,[10] 
        and partly corrupting them by means of daemons, he endeavoured to deify 
        himself—a sorcerer fellow and full of insanity, whom the apostles 
        confuted in the Acts. Far more prudent and modest was the aim of 
        Apsethus, the Libyan, who tried to get himself thought a god in Libya. 
        And as the story of Apsethus is not very dissimilar to the ambition of 
        the foolish Simon, it will not be unseemly to repeat it, for it is quite 
        in keeping with Simon's endeavour.8. Apsethus, the Libyan, wanted to become a god. But in spite of the 
        greatest exertions he failed to realize his longing, and so he desired 
        that at any rate people should think that he had become one; and, 
        indeed, for a considerable time he really did get people to think that 
        such was the case. For the foolish Libyans sacrificed to him as to some 
        divine power, thinking that they were placing their confidence in a 
        voice that came down from heaven.Well, he collected a large number of parrots and put them all into a 
        cage. For there are a great many parrots in Libya and they mimic the 
        human voice very distinctly. So he kept the birds for some time and 
        taught them to say, "Apsethus is a god." And when, after a long time, 
        the birds were trained and could speak the sentence which he considered 
        would make him be thought to be a god, he opened the cage and let the 
        parrots go in every direction. And the voice of the birds as they flew 
        about went out into all Libya, and their words reached as far as the 
        Greek settlements. And thus the Libyans, astonished at the voice of the 
        birds, and having no idea of the trick which had been played them by 
        Apsethus, considered him to be a god.But one of the Greeks, correctly surmising the contrivance of the 
        supposed god, not only confuted him by means of the self-same parrots, 
        but also caused the total destruction of this boastful and vulgar 
        fellow. For the Greek caught a number of the parrots and re-taught them 
        to say "Apsethus caged us and made us say, 'Apsethus is a god.'" And 
        when the Libyans heard the recantation of the parrots, they all 
        assembled together of one accord and burnt Apsethus alive.9. And in the same way we must regard Simon, the magician, more 
        readily comparing him with the Libyan fellow's thus becoming a god. And 
        if the comparison is a correct one, and the fate which the magician 
        suffered was somewhat similar to that of Apsethus, let us endeavour to
        re-teach the parrots of Simon, that he was not Christ, who has 
        stood, stands and will stand, but a man, the child of a woman, begotten 
        of seed, from blood and carnal desire, like other men. And that this is 
        the case, we shall easily demonstrate as our narrative proceeds.Now Simon in his paraphrasing of the Law of Moses speaks with artful 
        misunderstanding. For when Moses says "God is a fire burning and 
        destroying,"[11] 
        taking in an incorrect sense what Moses said, he declares that Fire is 
        the Universal Principle, not understanding what was said, viz., not that 
        "God is fire," but "a fire burning and destroying." And thus he not only 
        tears to pieces the Law of Moses, but also plunders from Heracleitus the 
        obscure.[12] 
        And Simon states that the Universal Principle is Boundless Power, as 
        follows:"This is the writing of the revelation of Voice and Name from 
        Thought, the Great Power, the Boundless. Wherefore shall it be sealed, 
        hidden, concealed, laid in the Dwelling of which the Universal Root is 
        the foundation."[13]And he says that man here below, born of blood, is the Dwelling, and 
        that the Boundless Power dwells in him, which he says is the Universal 
        Root. And, according to Simon, the Boundless Power, Fire, is not a 
        simple thing, as the majority who say that the four elements are simple 
        have considered fire also to be simple, but that the Fire has a twofold 
        nature; and of this twofold nature he calls the one side the concealed 
        and the other the manifested, (stating) that the concealed (parts) of 
        the Fire are hidden in the manifested, and the manifested produced by 
        the concealed.This is what Aristotle calls "in potentiality" and "in actuality," 
        and Plato the "intelligible" and "sensible."And the manifested side of the Fire has all things in itself which a 
        man can perceive of things visible, or which he unconsciously fails to 
        perceive. Whereas the concealed side is everything which one can 
        conceive as intelligible, even though it escape sensation, or which a 
        man fails to conceive.And generally we may say, of all things that are, both sensible and 
        intelligible, which he designates concealed and manifested, the Fire, 
        which is above the heavens, is the treasure-house, as it were a great 
        Tree, like that seen by Nabuchodonosor in vision, from which all flesh 
        is nourished. And he considers the manifested side of the Fire to be the 
        trunk, branches, leaves, and the bark surrounding it on the outside. All 
        these parts of the great Tree, he says, are set on fire from the 
        all-devouring flame of the Fire and destroyed. But the fruit of the 
        Tree, if its imaging has been perfected and it takes the shape of 
        itself, is placed in the storehouse, and not cast into the Fire. For the 
        fruit, he says, is produced to be placed in the storehouse, but the husk 
        to be committed to the Fire; that is to say, the trunk, which is 
        generated not for its own sake but for that of the fruit.10. And this he says is what is written in the scripture: "For the 
        vineyard of the Lord Sabaôth is the house of Israel, and a man of Judah 
        a well-beloved shoot."[14] 
        And if a man of Judah is a well-beloved shoot, it is shown, he says, 
        that a tree is nothing else than a man. But concerning its sundering and 
        dispersion, he says, the scripture has sufficiently spoken, and what has 
        been said is sufficient for the instruction of those whose imaging has 
        been perfected, viz.: "All flesh is grass, and every glory of the flesh 
        as the flower of grass. The grass is dried up and the flower thereof 
        falleth, but the speech of the Lord endureth for the eternity (aeon)."[15] 
        Now the Speech of the Lord, he says, is the Speech engendered in the 
        mouth and the Word (Logos), for elsewhere there is no place of 
        production.11. To be brief, therefore, the Fire, according to Simon, being of 
        such a nature—both all things that are visible and invisible, and in 
        like manner, those that sound within and those that sound aloud, those 
        which can be numbered and those which are numbered—in the Great 
        Revelation he calls it the Perfect Intellectual, as (being) 
        everything that can be thought of an infinite number of times, in an 
        infinite number of ways, both as to speech, thought and action, just as 
        Empedocles[16] 
        says:"By earth earth we perceive; by water, water; by aether [divine], 
        aether; fire by destructive fire; by friendship, friendship; and strife 
        by bitter strife."12. For, he says, he considered that all the parts of the Fire, both 
        visible and invisible, possessed perception[17] 
        and a portion of intelligence. The generable cosmos, therefore, was 
        generated from the ingenerable Fire. And it commenced to be generated, 
        he says, in the following way. The first six Roots of the Principle of 
        generation which the generated (sc., cosmos) took, were from that 
        Fire. And the Roots, he says, were generated from the Fire in pairs,[18] 
        and he calls these Roots Mind and Thought, Voice and Name, Reason and 
        Reflection, and in these six Roots there was the whole of the Boundless 
        Power together, in potentiality, but not in actuality. And this 
        Boundless Power he says is He who has stood, stands and will stand; who, 
        if his imaging is perfected while in the six Powers, will be, in 
        essence, power, greatness and completeness, one and the same with the 
        ingenerable and Boundless Power, and not one single whit inferior to 
        that ingenerable, unchangeable and Boundless Power. But if it remain in 
        potentiality only, and its imaging is not perfected, then it disappears 
        and perishes, he says, just as the potentiality of grammar or geometry 
        in a man's mind. For potentiality when it has obtained art becomes the 
        light of generated things, but if it does not do so an absence of art 
        and darkness ensues, exactly as if it had not existed at all; and on the 
        death of the man it perishes with him.13. Of these six Powers and the seventh which is beyond the six, he 
        calls the first pair Mind and Thought, heaven and earth; and the male 
        (heaven) looks down from above and takes thought for its co-partner, 
        while the earth from below receives from the heaven the intellectual 
        fruits that come down to it and are cognate with the earth. Wherefore, 
        he says, the Word ofttimes steadfastly contemplating the things which 
        have been generated from Mind and Thought, that is from heaven and 
        earth, says: "Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath 
        said: I have generated sons and raised them up, but they have set me 
        aside."[19]And he who says this, he says, is the seventh Power, He who has 
        stood, stands and will stand, for He is the cause of those good things 
        which Moses praised and said they were very good. And (the second pair 
        is) Voice and Name, sun and moon. And (the third) Reason and Reflection, 
        air and water. And in all of these was blended and mingled the Great 
        Power, the Boundless, He who has stood, as I have said.14. And when Moses says: "(It is) in six days that God made the 
        heaven and the earth, and on the seventh he rested from all his works," 
        Simon arranges it differently and thus makes himself into a god. When, 
        therefore, they (the Simonians) say, that there are three days before 
        the generation of the sun and moon, they mean esoterically Mind and 
        Thought—that is to say heaven and earth—and the seventh Power, the 
        Boundless. For these three Powers were generated before all the others. 
        And when they say "he hath generated me before all the Aeons," the 
        words, he says, are used concerning the seventh Power. Now this seventh 
        Power which was the first Power subsisting in the Boundless Power, which 
        was generated before all the Aeons, this, he says, was the seventh 
        Power, about which Moses says: "And the spirit of God moved over the 
        water," that is to say, he says, the spirit which hath all things in 
        itself, the Image of the Boundless Power, concerning which Simon says: "The 
        Image from, the incorruptible Form, alone ordering all things." For 
        the Power which moves above the water, he says, is generated from an 
        imperishable Form, and alone orders all things.Now the constitution of the world being with them after this or a 
        similar fashion, God, he says, fashioned man by taking soil from the 
        earth. And he made him not single but double, according to the image and 
        likeness. And the Image is the spirit moving above the water, which, if 
        its imaging is not perfected, perishes together with the world, seeing 
        that it remains only in potentiality and does not become in actuality. 
        And this is the meaning of the Scripture, he says: "Lest we be condemned 
        together with the world."[20] 
        But if its imaging should be perfected and it should be generated from 
        an "indivisible point," as it is written in his Revelation, the 
        small shall become great. And this great shall continue for the 
        boundless and changeless eternity (aeon), in as much as it is no 
        longer in the process of becoming.[21]How and in what manner, then, he asks, does God fashion man? In the 
        Garden (Paradise), he thinks. We must consider the womb a Garden, he 
        says, and that this is the "cave," the Scripture tells us when it says: 
        "I am he who fashioned thee in thy mother's womb,"[22] 
        for he would have it written in this way. In speaking of the Garden, he 
        says, Moses allegorically referred to the womb, if we are to believe the 
        Word.And, if God fashions man in his mother's womb, that is to say in the 
        Garden, as I have already said, the womb must be taken for the Garden, 
        and Eden for the region (surrounding the womb), and the "river going 
        forth from Eden to water the Garden,"[23] 
        for the navel. This navel, he says, is divided into four channels, for 
        on either side of the navel two air-ducts are stretched to convey the 
        breath, and two veins[24] 
        to convey blood. But when, he says, the navel going forth from the 
        region of Eden is attached to the foetus in the epigastric regions, that 
        which is commonly called by everyone the navel[25] 
        ... and the two veins by which the blood flows and is carried from the 
        Edenic region through what are called the gates of the liver, which 
        nourish the foetus. And the air-ducts, which we said were channels for 
        breath, embracing the bladder on either side in the region of the 
        pelvis, are united at the great duct which is called the dorsal aorta. 
        And thus the breath passing through the side doors towards the heart 
        produces the movement of the embryo. For as long as the babe is being 
        fashioned in the Garden, it neither takes nourishment through the mouth, 
        nor breathes through the nostrils. For seeing that it is surrounded by 
        the waters (of the womb), death would instantly supervene, if it took a 
        breath; for it would draw after it the waters and so perish. But the 
        whole (of the foetus) is wrapped up in an envelope, called the amnion, 
        and is nourished through the navel and receives the essence of the 
        breath through the dorsal duct, as I have said.15. The river, therefore, he says, which goes out of Eden, is divided 
        into four channels, four ducts, that is to say; into four senses of the 
        foetus: sight, (hearing),[26] 
        smelling, taste and touch. For these are the only senses the child has 
        while it is being formed in the Garden.This, he says, is the law which Moses laid down, and in accordance 
        with this very law each of his books was written, as the titles show. 
        The first book is Genesis, and the title of the book, he says, is 
        sufficient for a knowledge of the whole matter. For this Genesis, 
        he says, is sight, which is one division of the river. For the world is 
        perceived by sight.The title of the second book is Exodus. For it was necessary 
        for that which is born to travel through the Red Sea, and pass towards 
        the Desert—by Red the blood is meant, he says—and taste the bitter 
        water. For the "bitter," he says, is the water beyond the Red Sea, 
        inasmuch as it is the path of knowledge of painful and bitter things 
        which we travel along in life. But when it is changed by Moses, that is 
        to say by the Word, that bitter (water) becomes sweet. And that this is 
        so, all may hear publicly by repeating after the poets:"In root it was black, but like milk was the flower. Moly the Gods 
        call it. For mortals to dig it up is difficult; but Gods can do all 
        things."[27]16. Sufficient, he says, is what is said by the Gentiles for a 
        knowledge of the whole matter, for those who have ears for hearing. For 
        he who tasted this fruit, he says, was not only not changed into a beast 
        by Circe, but using the virtue of the fruit, reshaped those who had been 
        already changed into beasts, into their former proper shape, and 
        re-struck and recalled their type. For the true man and one beloved by 
        that sorceress is discovered by this milk-white divine fruit, he says.In like manner Leviticus, the third book, is smelling or 
        respiration. For the whole of that book treats of sacrifices and 
        offerings. And wherever there is a sacrifice, there arises the smell of 
        the scent from the sacrifice owing to the incense, concerning which 
        sweet smell the sense of smell is the test.Numbers, the fourth book, signifies taste, wherein speech (or 
        the Word) energizes. And it is so called through uttering all things in 
        numerical order.Deuteronomy, again, he says, is so entitled in reference to 
        the sense of touch of the child which is formed. For just as the touch 
        by contact synthesizes and confirms the sensations of the other senses, 
        proving objects to be either hard, warm, or adhesive, so also the fifth 
        book of the Law is the synthesis of the four books which precede it.All ingenerables, therefore, he says, are in us in potentiality but 
        not in actuality, like the science of grammar or geometry. And if they 
        meet with befitting utterance[28] 
        and instruction, and the "bitter" is turned into the "sweet"—that is to 
        say, spears into reaping hooks and swords into ploughshares[29]—the 
        Fire will not have born to it husks and stocks, but perfect fruit, 
        perfected in its imaging, as I said above, equal and similar to the 
        ingenerable and Boundless Power. "For now," says he, "the axe is nigh to 
        the roots of the tree: every tree," he says, "that bringeth not forth 
        good fruit, is cut down and cast into the fire."[30]17. And so, according to Simon, that blessed and imperishable 
        (principle) concealed in everything, is in potentiality, but not in 
        actuality, which indeed is He who has stood, stands and will stand; who 
        has stood above in the ingenerable Power, who stands below in the stream 
        of the waters, generated in an image, who shall stand above, by the side 
        of the blessed and Boundless Power, if the imaging be perfected. For 
        three, he says, are they that stand, and without there being three 
        standing Aeons, there would be no setting in order[31] 
        of the generable which, according to them, moves on the water, and which 
        is fashioned according to the similitude into a perfect celestial, 
        becoming in no whit inferior to the ingenerable Power, and this is the 
        meaning of their saying: "Thou and I, the one thing; before me, thou; 
        that after thee, I."This, he says, is the one Power, separated into the above and below, 
        generating itself, increasing itself, seeking itself, finding itself, 
        its own mother, its own father, its sister, its spouse; the daughter, 
        son, mother, and father of itself; One, the Universal Root.And that, as he says, the beginning of the generation of things which 
        are generated is from Fire, he understands somewhat in this fashion. Of 
        all things of which there is generation, the beginning of the desire for 
        their generation is from Fire. For, indeed, the desire of mutable 
        generation is called "being on fire." And though Fire is one, yet has it 
        two modes of mutation. For in the man, he says, the blood, being hot and 
        yellow—like fire when it takes form—is turned into seed, whereas in the 
        woman the same blood (is changed) into milk. And this change in the male 
        becomes the faculty of generating, while that in the female (becomes) 
        nourishment for the child. This, he says, is "the flaming sword that is 
        turned about to keep the way of the tree of life."[32] 
        For the blood is turned into seed and milk; and this Power becomes 
        mother and father, father of those that are born, and mother of those 
        that are nourished, standing in want of nothing, sufficient unto itself. 
        And the tree of life, he says, is guarded by the fiery sword which is 
        turned about, (which tree), as we have said, (is) the seventh Power 
        which proceeds from itself, contains all (in itself), and is stored in 
        the six Powers. For were the flaming sword not turned about, that fair 
        tree would be destroyed and perish; but if it is turned into seed and 
        milk, that which is stored in them in potentiality, having obtained a 
        fitting utterance,[33] 
        and an appointed place in which the utterance may be developed, starting 
        as it were from the smallest spark, it will increase to all perfection, 
        and expand, and be an infinite power, unchangeable, equal and similar to 
        the unchangeable Aeon, which is no more generated for the boundless 
        eternity.18. Conformably, therefore, to this reasoning, for the foolish, Simon 
        was a god, like that Libyan Apsethus; (a god) subject to generation and 
        suffering, so long as he remained in potentiality, but freed from the 
        bonds of suffering and birth, as soon as his imaging forth was 
        accomplished, and attaining perfection he passed forth from the first 
        two Powers, to wit heaven and earth. For Simon speaks distinctly 
        concerning this in his Revelation as follows:"To you, therefore, I say what I say, and write what I write. And 
        the writing is this."Of the universal Aeons there are two shoots, without beginning or 
        end, springing from one Root, which is the Power invisible, 
        inapprehensible Silence. Of these shoots one is manifested from above, 
        which is the Great Power, the Universal Mind ordering all things, male, 
        and the other, (is manifested) from below, the Great Thought, female, 
        producing all things."Hence pairing with each other,[34]
        they unite and manifest the Middle Distance, incomprehensible Air, 
        without beginning or end. In this is the Father who sustains all things, 
        and nourishes those things which have a beginning and end."This is He who has stood, stands and will stand, a male-female 
        power like the preëxisting Boundless Power, which has neither beginning 
        nor end, existing in oneness. For it is from this that the Thought in 
        the oneness proceeded and became two."So he[35]
        was one; for having her[36]
        in himself, he was alone, not however first, although preëxisting, 
        but being manifested from himself to himself, he became second. Nor was 
        he called Father before (Thought) called him Father."As, therefore, producing himself by himself, he manifested to 
        himself his own Thought, so also the Thought that was manifested did not 
        make the Father, but contemplating him hid him—that is to say the 
        Power—in herself, and is male-female, Power and Thought."Hence they pair with each other being one, for there is no 
        difference between Power and Thought. From the things above is 
        discovered Power, and from those below Thought."In the same manner also that which was manifested from them[37]
        although being one is yet found as two, the male-female having the 
        female in itself. Thus Mind is in Thought—things inseparable from one 
        another—which although being one are yet found as two."19. So then Simon by such inventions got what interpretation he 
        pleased, not only out of the writings of Moses, but also out of those of 
        the (pagan) poets, by falsifying them. For he gives an allegorical 
        interpretation of the wooden horse, and Helen with the torch, and a 
        number of other things, which he metamorphoses and weaves into fictions 
        concerning himself and his Thought.And he said that the latter was the "lost sheep," who again and again 
        abiding in women throws the Powers in the world into confusion, on 
        account of her unsurpassable beauty; on account of which the Trojan War 
        came to pass through her. For this Thought took up its abode in the 
        Helen that was born just at that time, and thus when all the Powers laid 
        claim to her, there arose faction and war among those nations to whom 
        she was manifested.It was thus, forsooth, that Stesichorus was deprived of sight when he 
        abused her in his verses; and afterwards when he repented and wrote the 
        recantation in which he sung her praises he recovered his sight.And subsequently, when her body was changed by the Angels and lower 
        Powers—which also, he says, made the world—she lived in a brothel in 
        Tyre, a city of Phoenicia, where he found her on his arrival. For he 
        professes that he had come there for the purpose of finding her for the 
        first time, that he might deliver her from bondage. And after he had 
        purchased her freedom he took her about with him, pretending that she 
        was the "lost sheep," and that he himself was the Power which is over 
        all. Whereas the impostor having fallen in love with this strumpet, 
        called Helen, purchased and kept her, and being ashamed to have it known 
        by his disciples, invented this story.And those who copy the vagabond magician Simon do like acts, and 
        pretend that intercourse should be promiscuous, saying: "All soil is 
        soil, and it matters not where a man sows, so long as he does sow." Nay, 
        they pride themselves on promiscuous intercourse, saying that this is 
        the "perfect love," citing the text, "the holy shall be sanctified by 
        the ... of the holy."[38] 
        And they profess that they are not in the power of that which is usually 
        considered evil, for they are redeemed. For by purchasing the freedom of 
        Helen, he (Simon) thus offered salvation to men by knowledge peculiar to 
        himself.[39]For he said that, as the Angels were misgoverning the world owing to 
        their love of power, he had come to set things right, being 
        metamorphosed and made like unto the Dominions, Principalities and 
        Angels, so that he was manifested as a man although he was not really a 
        man, and that he seemed to suffer[40] 
        in Judæa, although he did not really undergo it, but that he was 
        manifested to the Jews as the Son, in Samaria as the Father, and among 
        the other nations as the Holy Ghost, and that he permitted himself to be 
        called by whatever name men pleased to call him. And that it was by the 
        Angels, who made the world, that the Prophets were inspired to utter 
        their prophecies. Wherefore they who believe on Simon and Helen pay no 
        attention to the latter even to this day, but do everything they like, 
        as being free, for they contend that they are saved through his 
        (Simon's) grace.For (they assert that) there is no cause for punishment if a man does 
        ill, for evil is not in nature but in institution. For, he says, the 
        Angels who made the world, instituted what they wished, thinking by such 
        words to enslave all who listened to them. Whereas the dissolution of 
        the world, they (the Simonians) say, is for the ransoming of their own 
        people.20. And (Simon's) disciples perform magical ceremonies and (use) 
        incantations, and philtres and spells, and they also send what are 
        called "dream-sending" daemons for disturbing whom they will. They also 
        train what are called "familiars,"[41] 
        and have a statue of Simon in the form of Zeus, and one of Helen in the 
        form of Athena, which they worship, calling the former Lord and the 
        latter Lady. And if any among them on seeing the images, calls them by 
        the name of Simon or Helen, he is cast out as one ignorant of the 
        mysteries.While this Simon was leading many astray by his magic rites in 
        Samaria, he was confuted by the apostles. And being cursed, as it is 
        written in the Acts, in dissatisfaction took to these schemes. 
        And at last he travelled to Rome and again fell in with the apostles, 
        and Peter had many encounters with him for he continued leading numbers 
        astray by his magic. And towards the end of his career going ... he 
        settled under a plane tree and continued his teachings. And finally 
        running the risk of exposure through the length of his stay, he said, 
        that if he were buried alive, he would rise again on the third day. And 
        he did actually order a grave to be dug by his disciples and told them 
        to bury him. So they carried out his orders, but he has stopped away[42] 
        until the present day, for he was not the Christ.vi. Origenes (Contra Celsum, i. 57; v. 62; vi. ii). Text (edidit 
      Carol. Henric. Eduard); Lommatzsch; Berolini, 1846.v. 62. Then pouring out a 
        quantity of our names, he (Celsus) says he knows certain Simonians who 
        are called Heleniani, because they worship Helen or a teacher Helenus. 
        But Celsus is ignorant that the Simonians in no way confess that Jesus 
        is the Son of God, but they say that Simon is the Power of God, telling 
        some marvellous stories about the fellow, who thought that if he laid 
        claim to like powers as those which he thought Jesus laid claim to, he 
        also would be as powerful among men as Jesus is with many.vi. ii. For the former (Simon) pretended he was the Power of God, 
        which is called Great, and the latter (Dositheus) that he too was the 
        Son of God. For nowhere in the world do the Simonians any longer exist. 
        Moreover by getting many under his influence Simon took away from his 
        disciples the danger of death, which Christians were taught was taken 
        away, teaching them that there was no difference between it and 
        idolatry. And yet in the beginning the Simonians were not plotted 
        against. For the evil daemon who plots against the teaching of Jesus, 
        knew that no counsel of his own would be undone by the disciples of 
        Simon.vii. Philastrius (De Hæresibus, i). Text: Patres Quarti 
      Ecclesiæ Sæculi (edidit D.A.B. Caillau); Paris, 1842.And he 
        also dared to say that the world had been made by Angels, and the Angels 
        again had been made by certain endowed with perception from heaven, and 
        that they (the Angels) had deceived the human race.He asserted, moreover, that there was a certain other Thought, who 
        descended into the world for the salvation of men; he says she was that 
        Helen whose story is celebrated in the Trojan War by the vain-glorious 
        poets. And the Powers, he says, led on by desire of this Helen, stirred 
        up sedition. "For she," he says, "arousing desire in those Powers, and 
        appearing in the form of a woman, could not reäscend into heaven, 
        because the Powers which were in heaven did not permit her to reascend." 
        Moreover, she looked for another Power, that is to say, the presence of 
        Simon himself, which would come and free her.The wooden horse also, which the vain-glorious poets say was in the 
        Trojan War, he asserted was allegorical, namely, that that mechanical 
        invention typified the ignorance of all the impious nations, although it 
        is well known that that Helen, who was with the magician, was a 
        prostitute from Tyre, and that this same Simon, the magician, had 
        followed her, and together with her had practised various magic arts and 
        committed divers crimes.But after he had fled from the blessed Peter from the city of 
        Jerusalem, and came to Rome, and contended there with the blessed 
        apostle before the Emperor Nero, he was routed on every point by the 
        speech of the blessed apostle, and being smitten by an angel came by a 
        righteous end in order that the glaring falsity of his magic might be 
        made known unto all men.viii. Epiphanius (Contra Hæreses, ii. 1-6). Text: Opera (edidit 
      G. Dindorfius); Lipsiæ, 1859.2. So with his 
        mind in a vile state through the devilish illusions produced by his 
        magic, and weaving all kinds of images, and being ever ready of his own 
        villany to show his barbaric and demoniacal tricks by means of his 
        charms, he came forward publicly and under the cloak of the name of 
        Christ; and pretending that he was mixing hellebore[43] 
        with honey, he added a poison for those whom he hunted into his 
        mischievous illusion, under the cloak of the name of Christ, and 
        compassed the death of those who believed. And being lewd in nature and 
        goaded on through shame of his promises, the vagabond fabricated a 
        corrupt allegory for those whom he had deceived. For picking up a roving 
        woman, called Helen, who originated from the city of the Tyrians, he 
        took her about with him, without letting people know that he was on 
        terms of undue intimacy with her; and when he was involved in bursting 
        disgrace because of his mistress, he started a fabulous kind of 
        psychopompy[44] 
        for his disciples, and saying, forsooth, that he was the Great Power of 
        God, he ventured to call his prostitute companion the Holy Spirit, and 
        he says that it was on her account he descended. "And in each heaven I 
        changed my form," he says, "in order that I might not be perceived by my 
        Angelic Powers, and descend to my Thought, which is she who is called 
        Prunîcus[45] 
        and Holy Spirit, through whom I brought into being the Angels, and the 
        Angels brought into being the world and men." (He claimed) that this was 
        the Helen of old, on whose account the Trojans and Greeks went to war. 
        And he related a myth with regard to these matters, that this Power 
        descending from above changed its form, and that it was about this that 
        the poets spake allegorically. And through this Power from above—which 
        they call Prunîcus, and which is called by other sects Barbero or 
        Barbelo—displaying her beauty, she drove them to frenzy, and on this 
        account was she sent for the despoiling of the Rulers who brought the 
        world into being; and the Angels themselves went to war on her account; 
        and while she experienced nothing, they set to work to mutually 
        slaughter each other on account of the desire which she infused into 
        them for herself. And constraining her so that she could not reäscend, 
        each had intercourse with her in every body of womanly and female 
        constitution—she reïncarnating from female bodies into different bodies, 
        both of the human kingdom, and of beasts and other things—in order that 
        by means of their slaying and being slain, they might bring about a 
        diminution of themselves through the shedding of blood, and that then 
        she by collecting again the Power would be enabled to reäscend into 
        heaven.3. And she it was at that time who was possessed by the Greeks and 
        Trojans; and that both in the night of time before the world existed, 
        and after its existence, by the invisible Powers she had wrought things 
        of a like nature. "And she it is who is now with me, and on her account 
        have I descended. And she was looking for my coming. For she is the 
        Thought,[46] 
        called Helen in Homer." And it was on this account that Homer was 
        compelled to portray her as standing on a tower, and by means of a torch 
        revealing to the Greeks the plot of the Phrygians. And by the torch, he 
        delineated, as I said, the manifestation of the light from above. On 
        which account also the wooden horse in Homer was devised, which the 
        Greeks think was made for a distinct purpose, whereas the sorcerer 
        maintained that this is the ignorance of the Gentiles, and that like as 
        the Phrygians when they dragged it along in ignorance drew on their own 
        destruction, so also the Gentiles, that is to say people who are 
        "without my wisdom," through ignorance, draw ruin on themselves. 
        Moreover the impostor said that Athena again was identical with what 
        they called Thought, making use forsooth of the words of the holy 
        apostle Paul—changing the truth into his own lie—to wit: "Put on the 
        breastplate of faith and the helmet of salvation, and the greaves and 
        sword and buckler";[47] 
        and that all this was in the mimes of Philistion,[48] 
        the rogue!—words uttered by the apostle with firm reasoning and faith of 
        holy conversation, and the power of the divine and heavenly word—turning 
        them further into a joke and nothing more. For what does he say? That he 
        (Philistion) arranged all these things in a mysterious manner into types 
        of Athena. Wherefore again, in making known the woman with him whom he 
        had taken from Tyre and who had the same name as Helen of old, he spoke 
        as I have told you above, calling her by all those names, Thought, and 
        Athena, and Helen and the rest. "And on her account," he says, "I 
        descended. And this is the 'lost sheep' written of in the Gospel." 
        Moreover, he left to his followers an image, his own presumably, and 
        they worship it under the form of Zeus; and he left another in like 
        manner of Helen in the guise of Athena, and his dupes worship them.4. And he enjoined mysteries of obscenity and—to set it forth more 
        seriously—of the sheddings of bodies, emissionum virorom, feminarum 
        menstruorum, and that they should be gathered up for mysteries in a 
        most filthy collection; that these were the mysteries of life, and of 
        the most perfect Gnôsis—a practice which anyone who has understanding 
        from God would most naturally consider to be most filthy conduct and 
        death rather than life. And he supposes names for the Dominions and 
        Principalities, and says there are different heavens, and sets forth 
        Powers for each firmament and heaven, and tricks them out with barbarous 
        names, and says that no man can be saved in any other fashion than by 
        learning this mystagogy, and how to offer such sacrifices to the 
        Universal Father through these Dominions and Principalities. And he says 
        that this world (aeon) was constructed defectively by Dominions and 
        Principalities of evil. And he considers that corruption and destruction 
        are of the flesh alone, but that there is a purification of souls and 
        that, only if they are established in initiation by means of his 
        misleading Gnôsis. This is the beginning of the so-called Gnostics. And 
        he pretended that the Law was not of God, but of the left-hand Power, 
        and that the Prophets were not from the Good God but from this or the 
        other Power. And he lays it down for each of them as he pleases: the Law 
        was of one, David of another, Isaiah of another, Ezekiel again of 
        another, and ascribes each of the Prophets to some one Dominion. And all 
        of them were from the left-hand Power and outside the Perfection,[49] 
        and every one that believed in the Old Testament was subject to 
        death.5. But this doctrine is overturned by the truth itself. For if he 
        were the Great Power of God, and the harlot with him the Holy Spirit, as 
        he himself says, let him say what is the name of the Power or in what 
        word[50] 
        he discovered the epithet for the woman and nothing for himself at all. 
        And how and at what time is he found at Rome successively paying back 
        his debt, when in the midst of the city of the Romans the miserable 
        fellow fell down and died? And in what scripture did Peter prove to him 
        that he had neither lot nor share in the heritage of the fear of God? 
        And could the world not have its existence in the Good God, when all the 
        good were chosen by him? And how could it be a left-hand Power which 
        spake in the Law and Prophets, when it has preached the coming of the 
        Christ, the Good God, and forbids mean things? And how could there not 
        be one divine nature and the same spirit of the New and Old 
        Testament, when the Lord said: "I am not come to destroy the Law, 
        but to fulfil it"?[51] 
        And that He might show that the Law was declared through Him and was 
        given through Moses, and that the grace of the Gospel has been preached 
        through himself and his carnal presence, He said to the Jews: "If ye 
        believe Moses, ye should also believe me; for he wrote about me."[52] 
        There are many other arguments also to oppose to the contention of the 
        sorcerer. For how will obscene things give life, if it were not a 
        conception of daemons? When the Lord himself answers in the Gospel to 
        those who say unto him: "If such is the case of the man and the woman, 
        it is not good to marry." But He said unto them: "All do not hold this; 
        for there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the 
        kingdom of the heavens."[53] 
        And He showed that natural abstinence from union is the gift of the 
        kingdom of the heavens; and again in another place He says with respect 
        to righteous marriage—which Simon of his own accord basely corrupting 
        treats according to his own desires—"Whom God has joined together let no 
        man put asunder."[54]6. And how unaware is again the vagabond that he confutes himself by 
        his own babbling, not knowing what he gives out? For after saying that 
        the Angels were produced by him through his Thought, he goes on to say 
        that he changed his form in every heaven, to escape their notice in his 
        descent. Consequently he avoided them through fear. And how did the 
        babbler fear the Angels whom he had himself made? And how will not the 
        dissemination of his error be found by the intelligent to be instantly 
        refuted by everyone, when the scripture says: "In the beginning[55] 
        God made the heaven and the earth"?[56] 
        And in unison with this word, the Lord in the Gospel says, as though to 
        his own Father: "O Father, Lord of heaven and earth."[57] 
        If, therefore, the maker of heaven and earth is naturally God, the 
        Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, all that the slanderer Simon says is 
        vain; to wit, the defective production of the world by the Angels, and 
        all the rest he has babbled about in addition to his world of Daemons, 
        and he has deceived those who have been led away by him.ix. Hieronymus (In Matthaeum, IV. xxiv. 5). Text: S. Eusebii 
      Hieronymi Comment.; Migne Patrol. Grec., VII. col. 176.
        "I am the Word of God; I am the glorious one, I the Paraclete, the 
        Almighty, I the whole of God."x. Theodoretus (Hæreticarum Fabularum Compendium, I. i.). Text:

        But the divine grace armed great Peter against the fellow's madness. For 
        following after him, he dispelled his abominable teaching like mist and 
        darkness, and showed forth the rays of the light of truth. But for all 
        that the thrice wretched fellow, in spite of his public exposure, did 
        not cease from his working against the truth, until he came to Rome, in 
        the reign of Claudius Cæsar. And he so astonished the Romans with his 
        sorceries that he was honoured with a brazen pillar. But on the arrival 
        of the divine Peter, he stripped him naked of his wings of deception, 
        and finally, having challenged him to a contest in wonder-working, and 
        having shown the difference between the divine grace and sorcery, in the 
        presence of the assembled Romans, caused him to fall headlong from a 
        great height by his prayers and captured the eye-witnesses of the wonder 
        for salvation.This (Simon) gave birth to a legend somewhat as follows. He started 
        with supposing some Boundless Power; and he called this the Universal 
        Root.[60] 
        And he said that this was Fire, which had a twofold energy, the 
        manifested and the concealed. The world moreover was generable, and had 
        been generated from the manifested energy of the Fire. And first from it 
        (the manifested energy) were emanated three pairs, which he also called 
        Roots. And the first (pair) he called Mind and Thought, and the second, 
        Voice and Intelligence, and the third, Reason and Reflection. Whereas he 
        called himself the Boundless Power, and (said) that he had appeared to 
        the Jews as the Son, and to the Samaritans he had descended as the 
        Father, and among the rest of the nations he had gone up and down as the 
        Holy Spirit.And having made a certain harlot, who was called Helen, live with 
        him, he pretended that she was his first Thought, and called her the 
        Universal Mother, (saying) that through her he had made both the Angels 
        and Archangels; and that the world was fabricated by the Angels. Then 
        the Angels in envy cast her down among them, for they did not wish, he 
        says, to be called fabrications. For which cause, forsooth, they induced 
        her into many female bodies and into that of the famous Helen, through 
        whom the Trojan War arose.It was on her account also, he said, that he himself had descended, 
        to free her from the chains they had laid upon her, and to offer to men 
        salvation through a system of knowledge peculiar to himself.And that in his descent he had undergone transformation, so as not to 
        be known to the Angels that manage the establishment of the world. And 
        that he had appeared in Judæa as a man, although he was not a man, and 
        that he had suffered, though not at all suffering, and that the Prophets 
        were the ministers of the Angels. And he admonished those that believed 
        on him not to pay attention to them, and not to tremble at the threats 
        of the Law, but, as being free, to do whatever they would. For it was 
        not by good actions, but by grace they would gain salvation.For which cause, indeed, those of his association ventured on every 
        kind of licentiousness, and practised every kind of magic, fabricating 
        love philtres and spells, and all the other arts of sorcery, as though 
        in pursuit of divine mysteries. And having prepared his (Simon's) statue 
        in the form of Zeus, and Helen's in the likeness of Athena, they burn 
        incense and pour out libations before them, and worship them as gods, 
        calling themselves Simonians.
      
      The so-called Clementine Literature:A. Recognitiones. Text: Rufino Aquilei Presb. Interprete (curante

      Selecta, Vol. I. (edidit Albertus Schwegler); Tubingensis, Stuttgartiæ,

      Apostolicis Floruerunt Opera (edidit J.B. Cotelerius); Amsteladami, 
      1724.A. The priority of the two varying accounts, in the Homilies and
      Recognitiones, of the same story is in much dispute, but this is a 
      question of no importance in the present enquiry. The latest scholarship 
      is of the opinion that "the Clementines are unmistakably a production of 
      the sect of the Ebionites."[61] 
      The Ebionites are described as:Summary.[63] 
      Clement, the hero of the legendary narrative, arrives at Cæsarea Stratonis 
      in Judæa, on the eve of a great controversy between Simon and the apostle 
      Peter, and attaches himself to the latter as his disciple (H. II. xv; R.I. 
      lxxvii). The history of Simon is told to Clement, in the presence of 
      Peter, by Aquila and Nicetas—the adopted sons of a convert—who had 
      associated with Simon.Simon was the son of Antonius and Rachael, a Samaritan of Gittha, a 
      village six schoeni[64] 
      from the city of Cæsarea (H.I. xxii), called a village of the Gettones (R. 
      II. vii). It was at Alexandria that Simon perfected his studies in magic, 
      being an adherent of John, a Hemero-baptist,[65] 
      through whom he came to deal with religious doctrines.John was the forerunner of Jesus, according to the method of 
      combination or coupling.[66] 
      Whereas Jesus had twelve disciples, as the Sun, John, the Moon, had 
      thirty, the number of days in a lunation, or more correctly twenty-nine 
      and a half, one of his disciples being a woman called Helen, and a woman 
      being reckoned as half a man in the perfect number of the Triacontad, or 
      Plerôma of the Aeons (H.I. xxiii; R. II. viii). In the Recognitions 
      the name of Helen is given as Luna in the Latin translation of Rufinus.[67]Of all John's disciples, Simon was the favourite, but on the death of 
      his master, he was absent in Alexandria, and so Dositheus,[68] 
      a co-disciple, was chosen head of the school.Simon, on his return, acquiesced in the choice, but his superior 
      knowledge could not long remain under a bushel. One day Dositheus, 
      becoming enraged, struck at Simon with his staff; but the staff passed 
      through Simon's body like smoke, and Dositheus, struck with amazement, 
      yielded the leadership to Simon and became his disciple, and shortly 
      afterwards died (H.I. xxiv; R. II. xiii).Aquila and Nicetas then go on to tell how Simon had confessed to them 
      privately his love for Luna (R. II. viii), and narrate the magic 
      achievements possessed by Simon, of which they have had proof with their 
      own eyes. Simon can dig through mountains, pass through rocks as if they 
      were merely clay, cast himself from a lofty mountain and be borne gently 
      to earth, can break his chains when in prison, and cause the doors to open 
      of their own accord, animate statues and make the eye-witness think them 
      men, make trees grow suddenly, pass through fire unhurt, change his face 
      or become double-faced, or turn into a sheep or goat or serpent, make a 
      beard grow upon a boy's chin, fly in the air, become gold, make and unmake 
      kings, have divine worship and honours paid him, order a sickle to go and 
      reap of itself and it reaps ten times as much as an ordinary sickle (R. 
      II. xi).To this list of wonders the Homilies add making stones into 
      loaves, melting iron, the production of images of all kinds at a banquet; 
      in his own house dishes are brought of themselves to him (H.I. xxxii). He 
      makes spectres appear in the market place; when he walks out statues move, 
      and shadows go before him which he says are souls of the dead (H. IV. iv).On one occasion Aquila says he was present when Luna was seen looking 
      out of all the windows of a tower on all sides at once (R. II. xi).The most peculiar incident, however, is the use Simon is said to have 
      made of the soul of a dead boy, by which he did many of his wonders. The 
      incident is found in both accounts, but more fully in the Homilies 
      (I. xxv-xxx) than in the Recognitions (II. xiii-xv), for which 
      reason the text of the former is followed.Simon did not stop at murder, as he confessed to Nicetas and Aquila "as 
      a friend to friends." In fact he separated the soul of a boy from his body 
      to act as a confederate in his phenomena. And this is the magical modus 
      operandi. "He delineates the boy on a statue which he keeps 
      consecrated in the inner part of the house where he sleeps, and he says 
      that after he has fashioned him out of the air by certain divine 
      transmutations, and has sketched his form, he returns him again to the 
      air."Simon explains the theory of this practice as follows:"First of all the spirit of the man having been turned into the nature 
      of heat draws in and absorbs, like a cupping-glass, the surrounding air; 
      next he turns the air which comes within the envelope of spirit into 
      water. And the air in it not being able to escape owing to the confining 
      force of the spirit, he changed it into the nature of blood, and the blood 
      solidifying made flesh; and so when the flesh is solidified he exhibited a 
      man made of air and not of earth. And thus having persuaded himself of his 
      ability to make a new man of air, he reversed the transmutations, he said, 
      and returned him to the air."When the converts thought that this was the soul of the person, Simon 
      laughed and said, that in the phenomena it was not the soul, "but some 
      daemon[69] 
      who pretended to be the soul that took possession of people."The coming controversy with Simon is then explained by Peter to Clement 
      to rest on certain passages of scripture. Peter admits that there are 
      falsehoods in the scriptures, but says that it would never do to explain 
      this to the people. These falsehoods have been permitted for certain 
      righteous reasons (H. III. v)."For the scriptures declare all manner of things that no one of those 
      who enquire unthankfully may discover the truth, but (simply) what he 
      wishes to find" (H. III. x).In the lengthy explanation which follows, however, on the passages 
      Simon is going to bring forward, such as the mention of a plurality of 
      gods, and God's hardening men's hearts, Peter states that in reality all 
      the passages which speak against God are spurious additions, but this is 
      to be guarded as an esoteric secret.Nevertheless in the public controversy which follows, this secret is 
      made public property, in order to meet Simon's declaration: "I say that 
      there are many gods, but one God of all these gods, incomprehensible and 
      unknown to all" (R. II. xxxviii); and again: "My belief is that there is a 
      Power of immeasurable and ineffable Light, whose greatness is held to be 
      incomprehensible, a power which the maker of the world even does not know, 
      nor does Moses the lawgiver, nor your master Jesus" (R. II. xlix).A point of interest to be noticed is that Peter challenges Simon to 
      substantiate his statements by quotations either from the scriptures of 
      the Jews, or from some they had not heard of, or from those of the Greeks, 
      or from his own scriptures (R. II. xxxviii).Simon argues that finding the God of the Law imperfect, he concludes 
      this is not the supreme God. After a wordy harangue of Peter, Simon is 
      said to have been worsted by Peter's threatening to go to Simon's 
      bed-chamber and question the soul of the murdered boy. Simon flies to Tyre 
      (H.) or Tripolis (R.), and Peter determines to pursue him among the 
      Gentiles.The two accounts here become exceedingly contradictory and confused. 
      According to the Homilies, Simon flees from Tyre to Tripolis, and 
      thence further to Syria. The main dispute takes place at Laodicæa on the 
      unity of God (XVI. i). Simon appeals to the Old Testament to show 
      that there are many gods (XVI. iv); shows that the scriptures contradict 
      themselves (XVI. ix); accuses Peter of using magic and teaching doctrines 
      different to those taught by Christ (XVII. ii-iv); asserts that Jesus is 
      not consistent with himself (XVII. v); that the maker of the world is not 
      the highest God (XVIII. i); and declares the Ineffable Deity (XVIII. iv).[70] 
      Peter of course refutes him (XVIII. xii-xiv), and Simon retires.The last incident of interest takes place at Antioch. Simon stirs up 
      the people against Peter by representing him as an impostor. Friends of 
      Peter set the authorities on Simon's track, and he has to flee. At 
      Laodicæa he meets Faustinianus (R.), or Faustus (H.), the father of 
      Clement, who rebukes him (H. XIX. xxiv); and so he changes the face of 
      Faustinianus into an exact likeness of his own that he may be taken in his 
      place (H. XX. xii; R.X. liii). Peter sends the transformed Faustinianus to 
      Antioch, who, in the guise of Simon, makes a confession of imposture and 
      testifies to the divine mission of Peter. Peter accordingly enters Antioch 
      in triumph.The story of Simon in the Apostolic Constitutions is short and 
      taken from the Acts, and to some extent from the Clementines, 
      finishing up, however, with the mythical death of Simon at Rome, owing to 
      the prayers of Peter. Simon is here said to be conducted by daemons and to 
      have flown (ιπτατο) upwards. The 
      details of this magical feat are given variously elsewhere.[71]The only point of real interest is a vague reference to Simonian 
      literature (VI. xvi), in a passage which runs as follows:So end the most important of the legends. To these, however, must be 
      added others of a like nature of which the scene of action is laid at Rome 
      in the time of Nero.[73] 
      I have not thought it worth while to refer to the original texts for these 
      utterly apocryphal and unauthenticated stories, but simply append a very 
      short digest from the excellent summary of Dr. Salmon, the Regius 
      Professor of Divinity in Dublin University, as given in Smith and Wace's
      Dictionary of Christian Biography.[74]The Greek Acts of Peter and Paul give details of the conflict 
      and represent both apostles as having taken part in it. Simon and Peter 
      are each required to raise a dead body to life. Simon, by his magic, makes 
      the head move, but as soon as he leaves the body it again becomes 
      lifeless. Peter, however, by his prayers effects a real resurrection. Both 
      are challenged to divine what the other is planning. Peter prepares 
      blessed bread, and takes the emperor into the secret. Simon cannot guess 
      what Peter has been doing, and so raises hell-hounds who rush on Peter, 
      but the presentation of the blessed bread causes them to vanish.In the Acts of Nereus and Achilleus,[75] 
      another version of the story is given. Simon had fastened a great dog at 
      his door in order to prevent Peter entering. Peter by making the sign of 
      the cross renders the dog tame towards himself, but so furious against his 
      master Simon that the latter had to leave the city in disgrace.Simon, however, still retains the emperor's favour by his magic power. 
      He pretends to permit his head to be cut off, and by the power of glamour 
      appears to be decapitated, while the executioner really cuts off the head 
      of a ram.The last act of the drama is the erection of a wooden tower in the 
      Campus Martius, and Simon is to ascend to heaven in a chariot of fire. 
      But, through the prayers of Peter, the two daemons who were carrying him 
      aloft let go their hold and so Simon perishes miserably.Dr. Salmon connects this with the story, told by Suetonius[76] 
      and Dio Chrysostom,[77] 
      that Nero caused a wooden theatre to be erected in the Campus, and that a 
      gymnast who tried to play the part of Icarus fell so near the emperor as 
      to bespatter him with blood.So much for these motley stories; here and there instructive, but 
      mostly absurd. I shall now endeavour to sift out the rubbish from this 
      patristic and legendary heap, and perhaps we shall find more of value than 
      at present appears.
      NOTES:[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] As to the books of the followers of Cleobius we have no further 
              information.[73] [74] [75] [76] [77] 
            The student will at once perceive that though the Simon of the 
            Acts and the Simon of the fathers both retain the two features 
            of the possession of magical power and of collision with Peter, the 
            tone of the narratives is entirely different. Though the apostles 
            are naturally shown as rejecting with indignation the pecuniary 
            offer of the thaumaturge, they display no hate for his personality, 
            whereas the fathers depict him as the vilest of impostors and 
            charlatans and hold him up to universal execration. The incident of 
            Simon's offering money to Peter is admittedly taken by the fathers 
            from this account, and therefore their repetition in no way 
            corroborates the story. Hence its authenticity rests entirely with 
            the writer of the Acts, for Justin, who was a native of 
            Samaria, does not mention it. As the Acts are not quoted from 
            prior to A.D. 177, and their writer is only traditionally claimed to 
            be Luke, we may safely consider ourselves in the domain of legend 
            and not of history.The same may be said of all the incidents of Simon's career; they 
            pertain to the region of fable and probably owe their creation to 
            the Patristic and Simonian controversies of later ages.The Simon of Justin gives us the birthplace of Simon as at Gitta, 
            and the rest of the fathers follow suit with variation of the name. 
            Gitta, Gittha, Gittoi, Gitthoi, Gitto, Gitton, Gitteh, so run the 
            variants. This, however, is a matter of no great importance, and the 
            little burg is said to-day to be called Gitthoï.[78]The statement of Justin as to the statue of Simon at Rome with 
            the inscription "SIMONI DEO SANCTO" has been called in question by 
            every scholar since the discovery in 1574 of a large marble fragment 
            in the island of the Tiber bearing the inscription "SEMONI SANCO DEO 
            FIDIO," a Sabine God. A few, however, think that Justin could not 
            have made so glaring a mistake in writing to the Romans, and that if 
            it were a mistake Irenæus would not have copied it. The coincidence, 
            however, is too striking to bear any other interpretation than that 
            perhaps some ignorant controversialist had endeavoured to give the 
            legend a historical appearance, and that Justin had lent a too ready 
            ear to him. It is also to be noticed that Justin tells us that 
            nearly all the Samaritans were Simonians.We next come to the Simon of Irenæus which, owing to many 
            similarities, is supposed by scholars to have been taken from 
            Justin's account, if not from the Apology, at any rate from 
            Justin's lost work on heresies which he speaks of in the Apology. 
            Or it may be that both borrowed from some common source now lost to 
            us.The story of Helen is here for the first time given. Whether or 
            not there was a Helen we shall probably never know. The "lost sheep" 
            was a necessity of every Gnostic system, which taught the descent of 
            the soul into matter. By whatever name called, whether Sophia, 
            Acamôth, Prunîcus, Barbêlo, the glyph of the Magdalene, out of whom 
            seven devils are cast, has yet to be understood, and the mystery of 
            the Christ and the seven aeons, churches or assemblies (ecclesiæ), 
            in every man will not be without significance to every student of 
            Theosophy. These data are common to all Gnostic aeonology.If it is argued that Simon was the first inventor of this 
            aeonology, it is astonishing that his name and that of Helen should 
            not have had some recognition in the succeeding systems. If, on the 
            contrary, it is maintained that he used existing materials for his 
            system, and explained away his improper connection with Helen by an 
            adaptation of the Sophia-mythos, it is difficult to understand how 
            such a palpable absurdity could have gained any credence among such 
            cultured adherents as the Simonians evidently were. In either case 
            the Gnostic tradition is shown to be pre-Christian. Every initiated 
            Gnostic, however, must have known that the mythos referred to the 
            World-Soul in the Cosmos and the Soul in man.The accounts of the Acts and of Justin and Irenæus are so 
            confusing that it has been supposed that two Simons are referred to.[79] 
            For if he claimed to be a reïncarnation of Jesus, appearing in 
            Jerusalem as the Son, he could not have been contemporary with the 
            apostles. It follows, therefore, that either he made no such claim; 
            or if he made the claim, Justin and Irenæus had such vague 
            information that they confused him with the Simon of the Acts; 
            or that the supposition is not well-founded, and Simon was simply 
            inculcating the esoteric doctrine of the various manifestations or 
            descents of one and the same Christ principle.The Simon of Tertullian again is clearly taken from Irenæus, as 
            the critics are agreed. "Tertullian evidently knows no more than he 
            read in Irenæus," says Dr. Salmon.[80]It is only when we come to the Simon of the Philosophumena 
            that we feel on any safe ground. The prior part of it is especially 
            precious on account of the quotations from The Great Revelation 
            (η μεγαλη αποφασις) which we hear of from no 
            other source. The author of Philosophumena, whoever he was, 
            evidently had access to some of the writings of the Simonians, and 
            here at last we have arrived at any thing of real value in our 
            rubbish heap.It was not until the year 1842 that Minoides Mynas brought to 
            Paris from Mount Athos, on his return from a commission given him by 
            the French Government, a fourteenth-century MS. in a mutilated 
            condition. This was the MS. of our Philosophumena which is 
            supposed to have been the work of Hippolytus. The authorship, 
            however, is still uncertain, as will appear by what will be said 
            about the Simon of Epiphanius and Philaster.The latter part of the section on Simon in the Philosophumena 
            is not so important, and is undoubtedly taken from Irenæus or from 
            the anti-heretical treatise of Justin, or from the source from which 
            both these fathers drew. The account of the death of Simon, however, 
            shows that the author was not Hippolytus from whose lost work 
            Epiphanius and Philaster are proved by Lipsius to have taken their 
            accounts.The Simon of Origen gives us no new information, except as to the 
            small number of the Simonians. But like other data in his 
            controversial writings against the Gnostic philosopher Celsus we can 
            place little reliance on his statement, for Eusebius Pamphyli 
            writing in A.D. 324-5, a century afterwards, speaks of the Simonians 
            as still considerable in numbers.[81]The Simon of Epiphanius and Philaster leads us to speak of a 
            remarkable feat of scholarship performed by R.A. Lipsius,[82] 
            the learned professor of divinity in the university of Jena. From 
            their accounts he has reconstructed to some extent a lost work of 
            Hippolytus against heresies of which a description was given by 
            Photius. This treatise was founded on certain discourses of Irenæus. 
            By comparing Philaster, Epiphanius, and the Pseudo-Tertullian, he 
            recovers Hippolytus, and by comparing his restored Hippolytus with 
            Irenæus he infers a common authority, probably the lost work of 
            Justin Martyr, or, may we suggest, as remarked above, the work from 
            which Justin got his information.[83]The Simon of Theodoret differs from that of his predecessor only 
            in one or two important details of the aeonology, a fact that has 
            presumably led Matter to suppose that he has introduced some later 
            Gnostic ideas or confused the teachings of the later Simonians with 
            those of Simon.[84]The Simon of the legends is so entirely outside any historical 
            criticism, and the stories gleaned from the Homilies and 
            Recognitions are so evidently fabrications—most probably added 
            to the doctrinal narrative at a later date—and so obviously the 
            stock-in-trade legends of magic, that not a solitary scholar 
            supports their authenticity. Probably one of the reasons for this is 
            the strong Ebionism of the narratives, which is by no means 
            palatable to the orthodox taste. In this connection the following 
            table of the Ebionite scheme of emanation may be of interest:
            
            
                                  There remains but to mention the curious 
                                  theory of Bauer and the Tubingen school. It is 
                                  now established by recent theological 
                                  criticism that the Clementine writings were 
                                  the work of some member or members of the 
                                  Elkesaites, a sect of the Ebionites, and that 
                                  they were written at Rome somewhere in the 
                                  third century. The Elkessæans or Elkesaites 
                                  founded their creed on a book called 
                                  Elkesai, which purported to be an angelic 
                                  revelation and which was remarkable for its 
                                  hostility to the apostle Paul. As the 
                                  Recognitions contain much anti-Paulinism, 
                                  Bauer and his school not only pointed out the 
                                  Ebionite source of the Clementine literature, 
                                  but also put forward the theory that whenever 
                                  Simon Magus is mentioned Paul is intended; and 
                                  that the narrative of the Acts and the 
                                  legends simply tell the tale of the jealousy 
                                  of the elder apostles to Paul, and their 
                                  attempt to keep him from the fullest enjoyment 
                                  of apostolic privileges. But the latest 
                                  scholarship shakes its head gravely at the 
                                  theory, and however bitter controversialists 
                                  the anti-Paulinists may have been, it is not 
                                  likely that they would have gone so far out of 
                                  their way to vent their feelings in so 
                                  grotesque a fashion.In conclusion of this Part let us take a 
                                  general review of our authorities with regard 
                                  to the life of Simon and the immoral practices 
                                  attributed to his followers, including a few 
                                  words of notice on the lost Simonian 
                                  literature, and reserving the explanation of 
                                  his system and some notice of magical 
                                  practices for Part III.I have distinguished the Simon of the 
                                  fathers from the Simon of the legends, as to 
                                  biography, "by convention" and not "by 
                                  nature," as the Simonians would say, for the 
                                  one and the other is equally on a mythical 
                                  basis. It is easy to understand that the 
                                  rejection of the Simon of the legends is a 
                                  logical necessity for those who have to 
                                  repudiate the Ebionite Clementines. Admit the 
                                  authenticity of the narrative as regards 
                                  Simon, and the authenticity of the other 
                                  incidents about John the Baptist and Peter 
                                  would have to be acknowledged; but this would 
                                  never do, so Simon escapes from the clutches 
                                  of his orthodox opponents as far as this count 
                                  is concerned.But the biographical incidents in the 
                                  fathers are of a similar nature precisely to 
                                  those in the Clementines, and their sources of 
                                  information are so vague and unreliable, and 
                                  at such a distance from the time of their 
                                  supposed occurrence, that we have every reason 
                                  to place them in the same category with the 
                                  Clementine legends. Therefore, whether we 
                                  reject the evidence or accept it, we must 
                                  reject both accounts or accept both. To reject 
                                  the one and accept the other is a prejudice 
                                  that a partisan may be guilty of, but a 
                                  position which no unbiassed enquirer can with 
                                  justice take up.The legends, however, may find some excuse 
                                  when it is remembered that they were current 
                                  in a period when the metal of religious 
                                  controversy was glowing at white heat. 
                                  Orthodox Christians had their ears still 
                                  tingling with the echoing of countless 
                                  accusations of the foulest nature to which 
                                  they had been subjected. Not a crime that was 
                                  known or could be imagined that had not been 
                                  brought against them; they naturally, 
                                  therefore, returned the compliment when they 
                                  could do so with safety, and though in these 
                                  more peaceful and tolerant days much as we may 
                                  regret the flinging backwards and forwards of 
                                  such vile accusations, we may still find some 
                                  excuse for it in the passionate enthusiasm of 
                                  the times, always, however, remembering that 
                                  the readiest in accusation and in putting the 
                                  worst construction on the actions of others, 
                                  is generally one who unconsciously brings a 
                                  public accusation against his own lower 
                                  nature.This has been well noticed by Matter, who 
                                  writes as follows:
                                    The bolt of Eusebius is strong; it is even 
                                    too strong; for one can imagine nothing that 
                                    goes beyond the excess of criminality; and 
                                    Eusebius, belonging to a community who were 
                                    just escaping from punishments into which 
                                    accusations no less grave had caused them to 
                                    be dragged, should not perhaps have allowed 
                                    himself to speak as he does. But man is made 
                                    thus; he pursues when he ceases to be 
                                    pursued.[87]All societies that have secret rites and a 
                                  public position, as was the case with all the 
                                  early communities of Christians and Gnostics, 
                                  have had like accusations brought against 
                                  them. The communities of the Simonians and 
                                  Christians may or may not have been impure, it 
                                  is now impossible to pronounce a positive 
                                  opinion. The important point to notice is that 
                                  the accusations being identical and the 
                                  evidence or want of evidence the same, 
                                  condemnation or acquittal must be meted out to 
                                  both; and that if one is condemned and the 
                                  other acquitted, the judgment will stand 
                                  condemned as biassed, and therefore be set 
                                  aside by those who prefer truth to prejudice.So eager were the fathers to discredit 
                                  Simon that they contradict themselves in the 
                                  most flagrant fashion on many important 
                                  points. On the one hand we hear that Samaria 
                                  received the seed of the Word from the 
                                  apostles and Simon in despair had to flee, on 
                                  the other hand Justin, a native of Samaria, 
                                  tells us, a century after this supposed event, 
                                  that nearly all the Samaritans are Simonians. 
                                  The accounts of Simon's death again are 
                                  contradictory; if Simon perished so miserably 
                                  at Rome, it is the reverse of probable that 
                                  the Romans would have set up a statue in his 
                                  honour. But, indeed, it is a somewhat 
                                  thankless task to criticize such manifest 
                                  inventions; we know the source of their 
                                  inspiration, and we know the fertility of the 
                                  religious imagination, especially in matters 
                                  of controversy, and this is a sufficient sieve 
                                  wherewith to sift them out of our heap.I must now say a few words on Simonian 
                                  literature of which the only geniune specimens 
                                  we can in any way be certain are the 
                                  quotations from the Apophasis of Simon 
                                  in the text of the Philosophumena.That there was a body of Simonian 
                                  scriptures is undoubtedly true, as may be seen 
                                  from the passages we have quoted from the 
                                  Recognitions, Jerome, Pseudo-Dionysius and 
                                  the Arabic Preface to the Nicaean Council, and 
                                  for some time I was in hopes of being able to 
                                  collect at least some scattered fragments of 
                                  these works, but they have all unfortunately 
                                  shared the fate of much else of value that the 
                                  ignorance and fear of orthodoxy has committed 
                                  to the flames. We know at any rate that there 
                                  was a book called The Four Quarters of the 
                                  World, just as the four orthodox gospels 
                                  are dedicated to the signs of the four 
                                  quarters in the old MSS., and that a 
                                  collection of sentences or controversial 
                                  replies of Simon were also held in repute by 
                                  Simonians and were highly distasteful to their 
                                  opponents. Matter[88] 
                                  and Amélineau[89] 
                                  speak of a book by the disciples of Simon 
                                  called De la Prédication de S. Paul, 
                                  but neither from their references nor 
                                  elsewhere can I find out any further 
                                  information. In Migne's Encyclopédie 
                                  Théologique,[90] 
                                  also, a reference is given to M. Miller (Catalogue 
                                  des Manuscripts Grecs de l'Escurial, p. 
                                  112), who is said to mention a Greek MS. on 
                                  the subject of Simon ("un écrit en grec 
                                  relatif à Simon"). But I cannot find this 
                                  catalogue in the British Museum, nor can I 
                                  discover any other mention of this MS. in any 
                                  other author.At last I thought that I had discovered 
                                  something of real value in Grabe's 
                                  Spicilegium, purporting to be gleanings of 
                                  fragments from the heretics of the first three 
                                  centuries A.D.,[91] 
                                  but the date of the authority is too late to 
                                  be of much value. Grabe refers to the 
                                  unsatisfactory references I have already given 
                                  and, to show the nature of these books, 
                                  according to the opinion of the unknown author 
                                  or authors of the Apostolic Constitutions 
                                  (Grabe calls him the "collector," and for some 
                                  reason best known to himself places him in the 
                                  fourth century[92]), 
                                  quotes the following passage from their 
                                  legendary pages."Such were the doings of these people with 
                                  names of ill-omen slandering the creation and 
                                  marriage, providence, child-bearing, the Law 
                                  and the Prophets; setting down foreign names 
                                  of Angels, as indeed they themselves say, but 
                                  in reality, of Daemons, who answer back to 
                                  them from below."It is only when Grabe refers to the 
                                  Simonian Antirrhêtikoi Logoi, mentioned 
                                  by the Pseudo-Dionysius, which he calls "vesani 
                                  Simonis Refutatorii Sermones," that we get any 
                                  new information.A certain Syrian bishop, Moses Barcephas, 
                                  writing in the tenth century,[93] 
                                  professes to preserve some of these 
                                  controversial retorts of Simon, which the 
                                  pious Grabe—to keep this venom, as he calls 
                                  it, apart from the orthodox refutation—has 
                                  printed in italics. The following is the 
                                  translation of these italicized passages:"God willed that Adam should not eat of 
                                  that tree; but he did eat; he, therefore, did 
                                  not remain as God willed him to remain: it 
                                  results, therefore, that the maker of Adam was 
                                  impotent.""God willed that Adam should remain in 
                                  Paradise; but he of his own disgraceful act 
                                  fell from thence: therefore the God that made 
                                  Adam was impotent, inasmuch as he was unable 
                                  of his own will to keep him in Paradise.""(For) he interdicted (he said) Adam from 
                                  the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, by 
                                  tasting which he would have had power to judge 
                                  between good and evil, and to avoid this, and 
                                  follow after that.""But (said he) had not that maker of Adam 
                                  forbidden him to eat of that tree, he would in 
                                  no way have undergone this judgment and this 
                                  punishment; for hence is evil here, in that he 
                                  (Adam) had done contrary to the bidding of 
                                  God, for God had ordered him not to eat, and 
                                  he had eaten.""Through envy (said he) he forbade Adam to 
                                  taste of the tree of life, so that, of course, 
                                  he should not be immortal.""For what reason on earth (said he) did God 
                                  curse the serpent? For if (he cursed him) as 
                                  the one who caused the harm, why did he not 
                                  restrain him from so doing, that is, from 
                                  seducing Adam? But if (he cursed him) as one 
                                  who had brought some advantage, in that he was 
                                  the cause of Adam's eating of that good tree, 
                                  it needs must follow that he was distinctly 
                                  unrighteous and envious; lastly, if, although 
                                  from neither of these reasons, he still cursed 
                                  him, he (the maker of Adam) should most 
                                  certainly be accused of ignorance and folly."Now although there seems no reason why the 
                                  above contentions should not be considered as 
                                  in substance the arguments employed by Simon 
                                  against his antagonists of the dead-letter, 
                                  yet the tenth century is too late to warrant 
                                  verbal accuracy, unless there may have been 
                                  some Syrian translation which escaped the 
                                  hands of the destroyers. The above quoted 
                                  specimen of traditionary Simonian logic, 
                                  however, is interesting, and will, we believe, 
                                  be found not altogether out of date in our own 
                                  times.[94]Finally, there is one further point that I 
                                  have reserved for the end of this Part in 
                                  order that my readers may constantly keep it 
                                  in mind during the perusal of the Part which 
                                  follows.We must always remember that every single 
                                  syllable we possess about Simon comes from the 
                                  hands of bitter opponents, from men who had no 
                                  mercy or toleration for the heretic. The 
                                  heretic was accursed, condemned eternally by 
                                  the very fact of his heresy; an emissary of 
                                  Satan and the natural enemy of God. There was 
                                  no hope for him, no mercy for him; he was 
                                  irretrievably damned.[95] 
                                  The Simon of our authorities has no friend; no 
                                  one to say a word in his favour; he is hounded 
                                  down the byways of "history" and the highways 
                                  of tradition, and to crush him is to do God 
                                  service. One solitary ray of light beams forth 
                                  in the fragment of his work called The 
                                  Great Revelation, one solitary ray, that 
                                  will illumine the garbled accounts of his 
                                  doctrine, and speak to the Theosophists of 
                                  to-day in no uncertain tones that each may 
                                  say:

                                    antichrist, and who shall not confess the 
                                    martyrdom of the cross, is of the Devil; and 
                                    he who translates the words of the Lord 
                                    according to his own desires, and says there 
                                    is neither resurrection nor judgment, he is
                                    the first-born of Satan."
                                  In treating of eschatology and the 
                                  beginning of things the human mind is ever 
                                  beset with the same difficulties, and no 
                                  matter how grand may be the effort of the 
                                  intellect to transcend itself, the finite must 
                                  ever fail to comprehend the infinite. How much 
                                  less then can words define that which even the 
                                  whole phenomenal universe fails to express! 
                                  The change from the One to the Many is not to 
                                  be described. How the All-Deity becomes the 
                                  primal Trinity, is the eternal problem set for 
                                  man's solution. No system of religion or 
                                  philosophy has ever explained this 
                                  inexplicable mystery, for it cannot be 
                                  understood by the embodied Soul, whose vision 
                                  and comprehension are dulled by the grossness 
                                  of its physical envelope. Even the illuminated 
                                  Soul that quits its prison house, to bathe in 
                                  the light of infinitude, can only recollect 
                                  flashes of the Vision Glorious once it returns 
                                  again to earth.And this is also the teaching of Simon when 
                                  he says:This is a fundamental dogma of the Gnôsis 
                                  in all climes and in all ages. The demiurgic 
                                  deity is not the All-Deity, for there is an 
                                  infinite succession of universes, each having 
                                  its particular deity, its Brahmâ, to use the 
                                  Hindû term, but this Brahmâ is not THAT which 
                                  is Para-Brahman, that which is beyond Brahmâ.This view of the Simonian Gnôsis has been 
                                  magnificently anticipated in the Rig Veda 
                                  (x. 129) which reads in the fine translation 
                                  of Colebrooke as follows:In treating of emanation, evolution, 
                                      creation or whatever other term may be 
                                      given to the process of manifestation, 
                                      therefore, the teachers deal only with one 
                                      particular universe; the Unmanifested 
                                      Root, and Universal Cause of all Universes 
                                      lying behind, in potentiality (δυναμις), 
                                      in Incomprehensible Silence (σιγη 
                                      ακαταληπτος). For on the "Tongue of 
                                      the Ineffable" are many "Words" (λογοι), 
                                      each Universe having its own Logos.Thus then Simon speaks of the Logos of 
                                      this Universe and calls it Fire
                                      πυρ). 
                                      This is the Universal Principle or 
                                      Beginning (των 
                                      ολων αρχη), or Universal Rootage (ριζωμα 
                                      των ολων). But this Fire is not the 
                                      fire of earth; it is Divine Light and Life 
                                      and Mind, the Perfect Intellectual (το 
                                      τελειον νοερον). It is the One 
                                      Power, "generating itself, increasing 
                                      itself, seeking itself, finding itself, 
                                      its own mother, its own father, its 
                                      sister, its spouse: the daughter, son, 
                                      mother, and father of itself; One, the 
                                      Universal Root." It is That, "which has 
                                      neither beginning nor end, existing in 
                                      oneness." "Producing itself by itself, it 
                                      manifested to itself its own Thought (επινοια)."It is quite true that this symbology of 
                                      Fire is not original with Simon, but there 
                                      is also no reason to suppose that the 
                                      Samaritan teacher plagiarized from 
                                      Heracleitus when we know that the major 
                                      part of antiquity regarded fire and the 
                                      sun as the most fitting symbols of Deity. 
                                      Of the manifested elements, fire was the 
                                      most potent, and therefore the most 
                                      fitting symbol that could be selected in 
                                      manifested nature.But what was the Fire of Heracleitus, 
                                      the Obscure (ο σκοτεινος), as Cicero, with the rest of the 
                                      ancients, called him, because of his 
                                      difficult style? What was the Universal 
                                      Principle of the "weeping philosopher," 
                                      the pessimist who valued so little the 
                                      estimation of the vulgar (οχλολοιδορος)? 
                                      It certainly was no common "fire," 
                                      certainly no puerile concept to be brushed 
                                      away by the mere hurling of an epithet.Heracleitus of Ephesus (flor. c. 
                                      503 B.C.) was a sincerely religious man in 
                                      the highest sense of the word, a reformer 
                                      who strongly opposed the degenerate 
                                      polytheism and idolatry of his age; he 
                                      insisted on the impermanence of the 
                                      phenomenal universe, of human affairs, 
                                      beliefs and opinions, and declared the One 
                                      Eternal Reality; teaching that the Self of 
                                      man was a portion of the Divine 
                                      Intelligence. The object of his enquiry 
                                      was Wisdom, and he reproached his 
                                      vain-glorious countrymen of the city of 
                                      Diana with the words: "Your knowledge 
                                      of many things does not give you wisdom."In his philosophy of nature he declared 
                                      the One Thing to be Fire, but Fire of a 
                                      mystical nature, "self-kindled and 
                                      self-extinguished," the vital quickening 
                                      power of the universe. It was that 
                                      Universal Life, by participation in which 
                                      all things have their being, and apart 
                                      from which they are unsubstantial and 
                                      unreal. This is the "Tree of Life" spoken 
                                      of by Simon.In this Ocean of Fire or Life—in every 
                                      point or atom of it—is inherent a longing 
                                      to manifest itself in various forms, thus 
                                      giving rise to the perpetual flux and 
                                      change of the phenomenal world. This 
                                      Divine Desire, this "love for everything 
                                      that lives and breathes," is found in many 
                                      systems, and especially in the Vedic and 
                                      Phoenician Cosmogony. In the Rig Veda 
                                      (x. 129), it is that Kâma or Desire "which 
                                      first arose in It (the Unknown Deity)," 
                                      elsewhere identified with Agni or Fire. In 
                                      the fragments of Phoenician Cosmogony, 
                                      recovered from Sanchuniathon, it is called 
                                      Pothos (ποθος) 
                                      and Erôs (ερως).In its pure state, the Living and 
                                      Rational Fire of Heracleitus resides in 
                                      the highest conceivable Heaven, whence it 
                                      descends stage by stage, gradually losing 
                                      the velocity of its motion and vitality, 
                                      until it finally reaches the Earth-stage, 
                                      having previously passed through that of 
                                      "Water." Thence it returns to its parent 
                                      source.In this eternal flux, the only repose 
                                      was to be found in the harmony that 
                                      occasionally resulted from one portion of 
                                      the Fire in its descent meeting another in 
                                      its ascent. All this took place under Law 
                                      and Order, and the Soul of man being a 
                                      portion of the Fire in its pure state, and 
                                      therefore an exile here on Earth, could 
                                      only be at rest by cultivating as the 
                                      highest good, contentment (ευαρεστησις, 
                                      or acquiescence to the Law.The author of the Philosophumena 
                                      professes to give us some additional 
                                      information on this philosopher who 
                                      "bewailed all things, condemning the 
                                      ignorance of all that lives, and of all 
                                      men, in pity for the life of mortals," but 
                                      the obscure philosopher does not lend 
                                      himself very easily to the controversial 
                                      purposes of the patristic writer. 
                                      Heracleitus called the Universal Principle 
                                      (των 
                                      απαντων αρχη) Intellectual Fire (πυρ 
                                      νοερον), and said that the sphere 
                                      surrounding us and reaching to the Moon 
                                      was filled with evil, but beyond the 
                                      Moon-sphere it was purer.[97]The sentences that the author quotes 
                                      from Heracleitus in Book IX, are not only 
                                      obscure enough in themselves, but are also 
                                      rendered all the more obscure by the 
                                      polemical treatment they are subjected to 
                                      by the patristic writer. Heracleitus makes 
                                      the ALL inclusive of all Being and 
                                      Non-Being, all pairs of opposites, 
                                      "differentiation and non-differentiation, 
                                      the generable and ingenerable, mortal and 
                                      immortal, the Logos and Aeon, and the 
                                      Father and Son," which he calls the "Just 
                                      God." This ALL is the "Sadasat-Tatparam 
                                      yat" of the Bhagavad Gîtâ, 
                                      inclusive of Being (Sat), Non-Being (Asat), 
                                      and That Which transcends them (Tatparam 
                                      yat).[98]This Logos plays an important part in 
                                      the system of the Ephesian sage, who says 
                                      that they who give ear to the Logos (the 
                                      Word or Supreme Reason) know that "All is 
                                      One" (εν 
                                      παντα ειδεναι). Such an admission 
                                      he calls, "Reflex Harmony" (παλιντροπος 
                                      αρμονιη), like unto the Supernal 
                                      Harmony, which he calls Hidden or Occult, 
                                      and declares its superiority to the 
                                      Manifested Harmony. The ignorance and 
                                      misery of men arise from their not acting 
                                      according to this Harmony, that is to say, 
                                      according to (Divine) Nature (κατα 
                                      φυσιν).He also declares that the Aeon, the 
                                      Emanative Deity, is as a child playing at 
                                      creation, an idea found in both the Hindû 
                                      and Hermetic Scriptures. In the former the 
                                      Universe is said to be the sport (Lîlâ) of 
                                      Vishnu, who is spoken of in one of his 
                                      incarnations as Lîlâvatâra, descending on 
                                      earth for his own pleasure, when as 
                                      Krishna he assumed the shape of man as a 
                                      pretence (a purely Docetic doctrine), 
                                      hence called Lîlâ-mânusha-vigraha; while 
                                      in the latter we learn from a magic 
                                      papyrus that Thoth (the God of Wisdom) 
                                      created the world by bursting into "seven 
                                      peals of laughter." This, of course, 
                                      typifies the Bliss of the Deity in 
                                      Emanation or Creation, caused by that 
                                      Divine Love and Compassion for all that 
                                      lives and breathes, which is the 
                                      well-spring of the Supreme Cause of the 
                                      Universe.Diving into the Mystery of Being, 
                                      Heracleitus showed how a thing could be 
                                      good or evil, and evil or good, at one and 
                                      the same time, as for instance sea water 
                                      which preserved and nourished fishes but 
                                      destroyed men. So also, speaking in his 
                                      usual paradoxical manner, which can only 
                                      be understood by a full comprehension of 
                                      the dual nature of man,—the real divine 
                                      entity, and the passing and ever-changing 
                                      manifestation, which so many take for the 
                                      whole man—he says:Thus all externals are transitory, for 
                                      "no one has ever been twice on the same 
                                      stream, for different waters are 
                                      constantly flowing down," and therefore in 
                                      following externals we shall err, for 
                                      nothing is efficient and forcible except 
                                      through Harmony, and its subjection to the 
                                      Divine Fire, the central principle of 
                                      Life.Such was the Fire of the distinguished 
                                      Ephesian, and of like nature was the Fire 
                                      of Simon with its three primordial 
                                      hypostases, Incorruptible Form (αφταρτος 
                                      μορφη), Universal Mind (νους των ολων), and Great Thought (επινοια 
                                      μεγαλη), synthesized as the 
                                      Universal Logos, He who has stood, stands 
                                      and will stand (ο εστως, στας, στησομενος).But before passing on to the aeonology 
                                      of Simon, a short delay, to enquire more 
                                      fully into the notions of the Initiated 
                                      among the ancients as to the nature of 
                                      Mystic Fire, will not be without 
                                      advantage.If Simon was a Samaritan and learned in 
                                      the esoteric interpretation of scripture, 
                                      he could not have failed to be acquainted 
                                      with the Kabalah, perhaps even with the 
                                      now lost Chaldæan Book of Numbers. 
                                      Among the books of the Kabalah, the 
                                      Zohar, or "Book of Splendour," speaks 
                                      of the mysterious "Hidden Light," that 
                                      which Simon calls the Hidden Fire (το 
                                      κρυπτον), and tells us of the 
                                      "Mystery of the Three Parts of the Fire, 
                                      which are One" as follows:And if Chaldæa gave the impulse which 
                                      enshrined the workings of the Cosmos in 
                                      such graphic symbology as the above, we 
                                      are not surprised to read in the Chaldæan 
                                      Oracles (λογια),[101] 
                                      ascribed to Zoroaster, that "all things 
                                      are generated from One Fire."[102] 
                                      And this Fire in its first energizing was 
                                      intellectual; the first "Creation" was of 
                                      Mind and not of Works:A striking similarity with the Simonian 
                                      system, indeed, rendered all the closer by 
                                      the Oracle which speaks of that:This "flower" of Fire and the vorticle 
                                      idea is further explained by the Oracle 
                                      which says:Compare this with the teaching of Simon 
                                      that the "fruit" of the Tree is placed in 
                                      the Store-house and not cast into the 
                                      Fire.In his aeonology, Simon, like other 
                                      Gnostic teachers, begins with the Word, 
                                      the Logos, which springs up from the 
                                      Depths of the Unknown—Invisible, 
                                      Incomprehensible Silence. It is true that 
                                      he does not so name the Great Power, He 
                                      who has stood, stands and will stand; but 
                                      that which comes forth from Silence is 
                                      Speech, and the idea is the same whatever 
                                      the terminology employed may be. Setting 
                                      aside the Hermetic teachings and those of 
                                      the later Gnôsis, we find this idea of the 
                                      Great Silence referred to several times in 
                                      the fragments of the Chaldæan Oracles. It 
                                      is called "God-nourished Silence"
                                      σιγη θεοθρεμμων), according to whose divine 
                                      decrees the Mind that energizes before all 
                                      energies, abides in the Paternal Depth.[107] 
                                      Again:Elsewhere the Oracles demonstrate this 
                                      Power which is prior to the highest Heaven 
                                      as "Mystic Silence."[109]The Word, then, issuing from Silence is 
                                      first a Monad, then a Duad, a Triad and a 
                                      Hebdomad. For no sooner has 
                                      differentiation commenced in it, and it 
                                      passes from the state of Oneness (μονοτης), 
                                      than the Duadic and Triadic state 
                                      immediately supervene, arising, so to say, 
                                      simultaneously in the mind, for the mind 
                                      cannot rest on Duality, but is forced by a 
                                      law of its nature to rest only on the 
                                      joint emanation of the Two. Thus the first 
                                      natural resting point is the Trinity. The 
                                      next is the Hebdomad or Septenary, 
                                      according to the mathematical formula 2n-1, 
                                      the sum of n things taken 1, 2, 3 
                                      ... n, at a time. The Trinity being 
                                      manifested, n here =3; and 23-1 
                                      = 7.Thus Simon has six Roots and the 
                                      Seventh Power, seven in all, as the type 
                                      of the Aeons in the Plerôma. These all 
                                      proceed from the Fire. In like manner also 
                                      the Cabeiric deities of Samothrace and 
                                      Phoenicia were Fire-gods, born of the 
                                      Fire. Nonnus tells us they were sons of 
                                      the mysterious Hephaestus (Vulcan),[110] 
                                      and Eusebius, in his quotations from 
                                      Sanchuniathon, that they were seven 
                                      in number.[111] 
                                      The Vedic Agni (Ignis) also, the God of 
                                      Fire, is called "Seven-tongued" (Sapta-jihva) 
                                      and "Seven-flamed" (Sapta-jvâla).[112]In the Hibbert Lectures of 1887, 
                                      Prof. A.H. Sayce gives the following Hymn 
                                      of Ancient Babylonia to the Fire-god, from
                                      The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western 
                                      Asia (iv. 15):
                                        2. from the foundations of the earth he 
                                        appeared not to make hostility;3. (to) the heaven below they 
                                        extended (their path), and to the heaven 
                                        that is unseen they climbed afar.4. In the Star(s) of Heaven was not 
                                        their ministry; in Mazzaroth (the 
                                        Zodiacal signs) was their office.5. The Fire-god, the first-born 
                                        supreme, into heaven they pursued and no 
                                        father did he know.6. O Fire-god, supreme on high, the 
                                        first-born, the mighty, supreme enjoiner 
                                        of the commands of Anu!7. The Fire-god enthrones with 
                                        himself the friend that he loves.8. He reveals the enmity of those 
                                        seven.9. On the work he ponders in his 
                                        dwelling-place.10. O Fire-god, how were those seven 
                                        begotten, how were they nurtured?11. Those seven in the mountain of 
                                        the sunset were born;12. those seven in the mountain of 
                                        the sunrise grew up.13. In the hollows of the earth they 
                                        have their dwelling;14. on the high places of the earth 
                                        their names are proclaimed.15. As for them, in heaven and earth 
                                        they have no dwelling, hidden is their 
                                        name.16. Among the sentient gods they are 
                                        not known.17. Their name in heaven and earth 
                                        exists not.18. Those seven from the mountain of 
                                        the sunset gallop forth;19. those seven in the mountain of 
                                        the sunrise are bound to rest.20. In the hollows of the earth they 
                                        set the foot.21. On the high places of the earth 
                                        they lift the neck.22. They by nought are known; in 
                                        heaven and in earth is no knowledge of 
                                        them.[113]Though I have no intention of 
                                      contending that Simon obtained his ideas 
                                      specifically from Vedic, Chaldæan, 
                                      Babylonian, Zoroastrian, or Phoenician 
                                      sources, still the identity of ideas and 
                                      the probability, almost amounting to 
                                      conviction for the student, that the 
                                      Initiated of antiquity all drew from the 
                                      same sources, shows that there was nothing 
                                      original in the main features of the 
                                      Simonian system.This is also confirmed by the 
                                      statements in Epiphanius and the 
                                      Apostolic Constitutions that the 
                                      Simonians gave "barbarous" or "foreign 
                                      names" to their Aeons. That is to say, 
                                      names that were neither Greek nor Hebrew. 
                                      None of these names are mentioned by the 
                                      Fathers, and probably the Greek terms 
                                      given by the author of the 
                                      Philosophumena and Theodoret are 
                                      exoteric equivalents of the mystery names. 
                                      There is abundant evidence, from gems, 
                                      monuments and fragments, to show that 
                                      there was a mystery language employed by 
                                      the Gnostic and other schools. What this 
                                      language was no scholar has yet been able 
                                      to tell us, and it is sufficiently evident 
                                      that the efforts at decipherment are so 
                                      far abortive. The fullest and most 
                                      precious examples of these names and of 
                                      this language are to be found in the 
                                      papyri brought back by Bruce from 
                                      Abyssinia at the latter end of the last 
                                      century.[114]Jamblichus tells us that the language 
                                      of the Mysteries was that of ancient Egypt 
                                      and Assyria, which he calls "sacred 
                                      nations," as follows:The existence of this sacred tongue 
                                      perhaps accounts for the constant 
                                      distinction made by Homer between the 
                                      language of the gods and that of men.[116] 
                                      Diodorus Siculus also asserts that the 
                                      Samothracians used a very ancient and 
                                      peculiar dialect in their sacred rites.[117]These "barbarous names" were regarded 
                                      as of the greatest efficacy and sanctity, 
                                      and it was unlawful to change them. As the 
                                      Chaldæan Logia say:And the scholiast[119] 
                                      adds that they should not be translated 
                                      into Greek.It is, therefore, most probable that 
                                      Simon used the one, three, five, and seven 
                                      syllabled or vowelled names, and that the 
                                      Greek terms were substitutes that 
                                      completely veiled the esoteric meaning 
                                      from the uninitiated.The names of the seven Aeons, as given 
                                      by the author of the Philosophumena, 
                                      are as follows: The Image from the 
                                      Incorruptible Form, alone ordering all 
                                      things (εικων εξ αφθαρτου μορφης κοσμουσα μονη παντα), 
                                      also called The Spirit moving on the 
                                      Waters (το πνευμα το επιφερουμενον 
                                      επανω του υδατος) and The Seventh 
                                      Power (η 
                                      εβδομη δυναμις); Mind (νους) 
                                      and Thought (επινοια), 
                                      also called Heaven (ουρανος) 
                                      and Earth (γη); 
                                      Voice (φονη) 
                                      and Name (ονομα),[120] 
                                      also called Sun (ηλιος) 
                                      and Moon (σεληνη); 
                                      Reason (λογισμος) 
                                      and Reflection (ενθυμησις), 
                                      also called Air (αηρ) 
                                      and Water (υδορ).The first three of these are 
                                      sufficiently explained in the fragment of 
                                      Simon's Great Revelation, preserved 
                                      in the Philosophumena, and become 
                                      entirely comprehensible to the student of 
                                      the Kabalah who is learned in the 
                                      emanations of the Sephirothal Tree. Mind 
                                      and Thought are evidently Chokmah and 
                                      Binah, and the three and seven Sephiroth 
                                      are to be clearly recognized in the scheme 
                                      of the Simonian System which is to follow.Of the two lower Syzygies, or Lower 
                                      Quaternary of the Aeons, we have no 
                                      details from the Fathers. We may, however, 
                                      see some reason for the exoteric 
                                      names—Voice and Name, Reason and 
                                      Reflection—from the following 
                                      considerations:(1) We should bear in mind what has 
                                      already been said about the Logos, Speech 
                                      and Divine Names. (2) In the Septenary the 
                                      Quaternary represents the Manifested and 
                                      the Triad the Concealed Side of the Fire. 
                                      (3) The fundamental characteristics of the 
                                      manifested universe with the Hindûs and 
                                      Buddhists are Name (Nâma) and Form (Rûpa). 
                                      (4) Simon says that the Great Power was 
                                      not called Father until Thought (in 
                                      manifestation becoming Voice) named 
                                      (ονομασαι) 
                                      him Father. (5) Reason and Reflection are 
                                      evidently the two lowest aspects, 
                                      principles, or characteristics, of the 
                                      divine Mind of man. These are included 
                                      in the lower mind, or Internal Organ (Antah-karana), 
                                      by the Vedântin philosophers of India and 
                                      called Buddhi and Manas, being 
                                      respectively the mental faculties used in 
                                      the certainty of judgment and the doubt of 
                                      enquiry.This Quaternary, among a host of other 
                                      things, typifies the four lower planes, 
                                      elements, principles, aspects, etc., of 
                                      the Universe, with their Hierarchies of 
                                      Angels, Archangels, Rulers, etc., each 
                                      synthesized by a Lord who is supreme in 
                                      his own domain. Seeing, however, that the 
                                      outermost physical plane is so vast that 
                                      it transcends the power of conception of 
                                      even the greatest intellect, it is useless 
                                      for us to speculate on the interplay of 
                                      cosmic forces and the mysterious 
                                      interaction of Spheres of Being that 
                                      transcend all normal human consciousness. 
                                      It is only on the lowest and outermost 
                                      plane that the lower Quaternary symbolizes 
                                      the four Cardinal Points. The Michael 
                                      (Sun), Gabriel (Moon), Uriel (Venus), and 
                                      Raphael (Mercury) of the Kabalah, the four 
                                      Beasts, the Wheels of Ezekiel, were 
                                      living, divine, and intelligent Entities 
                                      pertaining to the inner nature of man and 
                                      the universe for the Initiated.It is to be presumed that the Simonians 
                                      had distinct teachings on this point, as 
                                      is evidenced by the title of their lost 
                                      work, The Book of the Four Angles and 
                                      Points of the World. The Four Angles 
                                      were probably connected with the four 
                                      ducts or Streams of the "River going forth 
                                      from Eden to water the Garden." These 
                                      Streams have their analogy on all planes, 
                                      and cosmically are of the same nature as 
                                      the Âkâsha-Gangâ—the Ganges in the Akâshic 
                                      Ocean of Space—and the rest of the Rivers 
                                      in the Paurânic writings of the Hindûs.But before going further it will be as 
                                      well to have a Diagram or Scheme of the 
                                      Simonian Aeonology, for presumably the 
                                      School of Simon had such a Scheme, as we 
                                      know the Ophites had from the work of 
                                      Origen, Contra Celsum.
                                      
                                      Of course no Diagram is anything more 
                                      than a symbolical mnemonic, so to say; in 
                                      itself it is entirely insufficient and 
                                      only permits a glance at one aspect, or 
                                      face, of the world-process. It is a step 
                                      in a ladder merely, useful only for 
                                      mounting and to be left aside when once a 
                                      higher rung is reached. Thus it is that 
                                      the whole of the elements of Euclid were 
                                      merely an introduction to the 
                                      comprehension of the "Platonic Solids," 
                                      which must also, in their turn, be 
                                      discarded when the within or essence of 
                                      things has to be dealt with and not the 
                                      without or appearance, no matter how 
                                      "typical" that appearance may be.Sufficient has already been said of the 
                                      Universal Principle, of the Universal Root 
                                      and of the Boundless Power—the Parabrahman 
                                      (That Which transcends Brahmâ), 
                                      Mûla-Prakriti (Root-Nature), and Supreme 
                                      Îshvara, or the Unmanifested Eternal 
                                      Logos, of the Vedântic Philosophers. The 
                                      next stage is the potential unmanifested 
                                      type of the Trinity, the Three in One and 
                                      One in Three, the Potentialities of 
                                      Vishnu, Brahmâ, and Shiva, the 
                                      Preservative, Emanative, and Regenerative 
                                      Powers—the Supreme Logos, Universal 
                                      Ideation and Potential Wisdom, called by 
                                      Simon the Incorruptible Form, Universal 
                                      Mind and Great Thought. This Incorruptible 
                                      Form is the Paradigm of all Forms, called 
                                      Vishva Rûpam or All-Form and the Param 
                                      Rûpam or Supreme Form, in the Bhagavad 
                                      Gîtâ[122] 
                                      spoken also of as the Param Nidhânam or 
                                      Supreme Treasure-house,[123] 
                                      which Simon also calls the Treasure-house
                                      
                                      θησαυρος and Store-house
                                      αποθηκη, 
                                      an idea found in many systems, and most 
                                      elaborately in that of the 
                                      Pistis-Sophia.Between this Divine World, the 
                                      Unmanifested Triple Aeon, and the World of 
                                      Men is the Middle Distance—the Waters of 
                                      Space differentiated by the Image or 
                                      Reflection of the Triple Logos (D) 
                                      brooding upon them. As there are three 
                                      Worlds, the Divine, Middle, and Lower, 
                                      which have been well named by the 
                                      Valentinians the Pneumatic (or Spiritual), 
                                      Psychic (or Soul-World), and Hylic (or 
                                      Material), so in the Middle Distance we 
                                      have three planes or degrees, or even 
                                      seven. This Middle Distance contains the 
                                      Invisible Spheres between the Physical 
                                      World and the Divine. To it the Initiated 
                                      and Illuminati, the Spiritual Teachers of 
                                      all ages, have devoted much exposition and 
                                      explanation. It is divine and infernal at 
                                      one and the same time, for as the higher 
                                      parts—to use a phrase that is clumsy and 
                                      misleading, but which cannot be 
                                      avoided—are pure and spiritual, so the 
                                      lower parts are corrupted and tainted. The 
                                      law of analogy, imaging and reflection, 
                                      hold good in every department of emanative 
                                      nature, and though pure and spiritual 
                                      ideas come to men from this realm of the 
                                      Middle Distance, it also receives back 
                                      from man the impressions of his impure 
                                      thoughts and desires, so that its lower 
                                      parts are fouler even than the physical 
                                      world, for man's secret thoughts and 
                                      passions are fouler than the deeds he 
                                      performs. Thus there is a Heaven and Hell 
                                      in the Middle Distance, a Pneumatic and 
                                      Hylic state.The Lord of this Middle World is One in 
                                      his own Aeon, but in reality a reflection 
                                      of the triple radiance from the 
                                      Unmanifested Logos. This Lord is the 
                                      Manifested Logos, the Spirit moving on the 
                                      Waters. Therefore all its emanations or 
                                      creations are triple. The triple Light 
                                      above and the triple Darkness below, force 
                                      and matter, or spirit and matter, both 
                                      owing their being and apparent opposition 
                                      to the Mind, "alone ordering all things."The Diagram to be more comprehensible 
                                      should be so arranged, mentally, that each 
                                      of the higher spheres is found within or 
                                      interpenetrating the lower. Thus, from 
                                      this point of view, the centre is a more 
                                      important position than above or below. 
                                      External to all is the Physical Universe, 
                                      made by the Hylic Angels, that is to say 
                                      those emanated by Thought, Epinoia, as 
                                      representing Primeval Mother Earth, or 
                                      Matter; not the Earth we know, but the 
                                      Adamic Earth of the Philosophers, the 
                                      Potencies of Matter, which Eugenius 
                                      Philalethes assures us, on his honour, no 
                                      man has ever seen. This Earth is, in one 
                                      sense, the Protyle for which the most 
                                      advanced of our modern Chemists are 
                                      searching as the One Mother Element.The idea of the Spirit of God moving on 
                                      the Waters is a very beautiful one, and we 
                                      find it worked out in much detail in the 
                                      Hindû scriptures. For instance, in the 
                                      Vishnu Purâna,[124] 
                                      we find a description of the emanation of 
                                      the present Universe by the Supreme 
                                      Spirit, at the beginning of the present 
                                      Kalpa or Aeon, an infinity of Kalpas and 
                                      Universes stretching behind. This he 
                                      creates endowed with the Quality of 
                                      Goodness, or the Pneumatic Potency. For 
                                      the three Qualities (or Gunas) of Nature (Prakriti) 
                                      are the Pneumatic, Psychic and Hylic 
                                      Potencies of the Waters of Simon.Sir Wm. Jones translates this 
                                      well-known verse of Manu[127] 
                                      as follows:Substantially the same statement is 
                                      made in the Linga, Vâyu, and 
                                      Mârkandeya Purânas, and the 
                                      Bhâgavata explains it more fully as 
                                      follows:In the Vishnu Purâna, again, 
                                      Brahmâ, speaking to the Celestials, says:The beautiful symbol of the Divine 
                                      Spirit moving and brooding over the 
                                      Primordial Waters of Space—Waters which as 
                                      differentiation proceeds become more and 
                                      more turbid—is too graphic to require 
                                      further explanation. It is too hallowed by 
                                      age and sanctified by the consent of 
                                      humanity to meet with less than our 
                                      highest admiration.Dissertation on our Diagram could be 
                                      pursued to almost any length, but 
                                      sufficient has already been said to show 
                                      the points of correspondence between the 
                                      ideas ascribed to Simon and universal 
                                      Theosophy.Let us now enquire into the part played 
                                      by Epinoia, the Divine Thought, in the 
                                      cosmic process, reserving the part played 
                                      by her in the human drama to when we come 
                                      to treat of the soteriology of Simon. We 
                                      have evidently here a version of the great 
                                      Sophia-mythus, which plays so important a 
                                      part in all Gnostic systems. On the one 
                                      hand the energizings of the mother-side of 
                                      Divine Nature, on the other the history of 
                                      the evolution of the Divine Monad, shut 
                                      into all forms throughout the elemental 
                                      spheres, throughout the lower kingdoms, up 
                                      to the man stage.The mystery of Sophia-Epinoia is great 
                                      indeed, insoluble in its origins; for how 
                                      does that which is Divine descend below 
                                      and create Powers which imprison their 
                                      parent? It is the mystery of the universe 
                                      and of man, insoluble for all but the 
                                      Logos itself, by whose self-sacrifice 
                                      Sophia, the Soul, is finally freed from 
                                      her bonds.Epinoia is a Power of many names. She 
                                      is called the Mother, or All-Mother, 
                                      Mother of the Living or Shining Mother, 
                                      the Celestial Eve; the Power Above; the 
                                      Holy Spirit, for the Spiritus in some 
                                      systems is a feminine power (in a 
                                      symbolical sense, of course), 
                                      pre-eminently in the Codex Nazaræus, 
                                      the scripture of the Mandaïtes. Again she 
                                      is called She of the Left-hand, as opposed 
                                      to the Christos, He of the Right-hand; the 
                                      Man-woman; Prouneikos; Matrix; Paradise; 
                                      Eden; Achamôth; the Virgin; Barbelo; 
                                      Daughter of Light; Merciful Mother; 
                                      Consort of the Masculine One; Revelant of 
                                      the Perfect Mysteries; Perfect Mercy; 
                                      Revelant of the Mysteries of the Whole 
                                      Magnitude; Hidden Mother; She who knows 
                                      the Mysteries of the Elect; the Holy Dove, 
                                      who has given birth to the two Twins; 
                                      Ennoia; and by many another name varying 
                                      according to the terminology of the 
                                      different systems, but ever preserving the 
                                      root idea of the World-Soul in the 
                                      Macrocosm and the Soul in Man.Within every form, aye, even apparently 
                                      the meanest, is Epinoia confined; for 
                                      everything within is innate with Life; 
                                      every form contains a spark of the Divine 
                                      Fire, essentially of the same nature as 
                                      the All; for in the Roots, and also in all 
                                      things—since all is built on their type—is 
                                      "the whole of the Boundless Power together
                                      in potentiality, but not in 
                                      actuality."The reason given for this imprisonment 
                                      of Sophia in most of the systems is that 
                                      she endeavoured to create without her 
                                      Syzygy, the Father or Nous, wishing to 
                                      imitate alone the self-generating power of 
                                      the Supreme. Thus through ignorance she 
                                      involved herself in suffering, from which 
                                      she was freed by repentance and 
                                      experience. What explanation of this 
                                      supreme mystery was publicly ventured on 
                                      by Simon we cannot know, for the patristic 
                                      accounts are confused and contradictory.Irenæus tells us that:This Epinoia, leaping 
                                        forth from him (the Boundless 
                                        Power), and knowing what was the will of 
                                        her Father, descended to the Lower 
                                        Regions and generated the Angels and 
                                        Powers, by whom also he said the world 
                                        was made. And after she had generated 
                                        them, she was detained by them through 
                                        envy, for they did not wish to be 
                                        thought the progeny of another. As for 
                                        himself he was entirely unknown by them; 
                                        and it was his Thought (Epinoia) that 
                                        was made prisoner by the Powers and 
                                        Angels that had been emanated by her. 
                                        And she suffered every kind of indignity 
                                        at their hands to prevent her 
                                        reäscending to her Father, even to being 
                                        imprisoned in the human body and 
                                        transmigrating into other female bodies, 
                                        as from one vessel into another.Tertullian's account differs by the 
                                      important addition that the "design of the 
                                      Father was prevented"; how or why he does 
                                      not say.The Philosophumena say nothing 
                                      on this point, except that Epinoia "throws 
                                      all the Powers in the World into confusion 
                                      through her unsurpassable Beauty."Philaster renders confusion worse 
                                      confounded, by writing:He asserted, moreover, that 
                                        there was a certain other Thought (Intellectus) 
                                        who descended into the world for the 
                                        salvation of men.Epiphanius further complicates the 
                                      problem as follows:Theodoret briefly follows Irenæus.In these contradictory accounts we have 
                                      a great confusion between the rôles played 
                                      by Nous and Epinoia, the Father and 
                                      Thought, the Spirit and Spiritual Soul. 
                                      Then again how did the Lower Regions come 
                                      into existence, for Epinoia to descend to 
                                      them? This lacuna is filled by the fuller 
                                      information of the Philosophumena 
                                      which shows us the scheme of 
                                      self-emanation out or down into matter by 
                                      similitude, thus confining the problem of 
                                      "evil" to space and time, and not raising 
                                      it into an eternal principle. Naturally it 
                                      is not to be supposed that the origin of 
                                      "evil" is solvable for man in his present 
                                      state, therefore whether it was according 
                                      to the design or contrary to the design of 
                                      the Father, will ever depend upon the 
                                      point of view from which we severally 
                                      regard the problem.Law, Justice, and Compassion are not 
                                      incompatible terms to one whose heart is 
                                      set firm on spiritual things; and the view 
                                      that evil is not a thing in itself, but 
                                      exists only because of human ignorance, is 
                                      one that must commend itself to the truly 
                                      religious and philosophical mind. Thus 
                                      evil is not a fixed quantity in itself, it 
                                      depends on the internal attitude each man 
                                      holds with regard to externals as to 
                                      whether they are evil or no.For instance, it is not evil for an 
                                      animal or savage to kill, for the light of 
                                      the higher law is not yet flaming brightly 
                                      in their hearts. That only is evil if we 
                                      do what is displeasing to the Self. This 
                                      may perhaps throw some light on the 
                                      Simonian dogma of action by accident (ex 
                                      accidenti), or institution (θεσει), 
                                      as opposed to action according to nature (naturaliter 
                                      or φυσει)—evidently 
                                      the same idea as the teaching of 
                                      Heracleitus to act according to nature (κατα 
                                      φυσιν) which he explains as 
                                      according to the Unmanifested Harmony 
                                      which we can hear by straining our ears to 
                                      catch that still small voice within, the 
                                      Voice of the Silence, the Logos or Self. 
                                      Simon presumably refers to this in the 
                                      phrase "the things which sound within" (τα 
                                      ενηχα), an idea remarkably 
                                      confirmed by Psellus,[129] 
                                      who quotes the following Logion:This brings us to a consideration of 
                                      the teachings of Simon with regard to the 
                                      Lesser World, the Microcosm, Man, and to 
                                      the scheme of his soteriology. Evidently 
                                      Simon taught the ancient, immemorial 
                                      doctrine that the Microcosm Man was the 
                                      Mirror and Potentiality of the Cosmos, the 
                                      Macrocosm, as we have already seen above. 
                                      Whatever was true of the emanation of the 
                                      Universe, was also true of Man, whatever 
                                      was true of the Macrocosmic Aeons was true 
                                      of the Microcosmic Aeons in Man, which are 
                                      potentially the same as those of the 
                                      Cosmos, and will develop into the power 
                                      and grandeur of the latter, if they can 
                                      find suitable expression, or a fit 
                                      vehicle. This view will explain the reason 
                                      of the ancients for saying that we could 
                                      only perceive that of which we have a germ 
                                      already within us. Thus it is that 
                                      Empedocles taught:And if the potentiality of all resided 
                                      in every man, the teaching on this point 
                                      most forcibly has been, Qui se 
                                      cognoscit, in se omnia cognoscit—He 
                                      who knows himself, knows all in himself—as 
                                      Q. Fabius Pictor tells us. And, therefore, 
                                      the essential of moral and spiritual 
                                      training in ancient times was the 
                                      attainment of Self-Knowledge—that is to 
                                      say, the attainment of the certitude that 
                                      there is a divine nature within every man, 
                                      which is of infinite capacity to absorb 
                                      universal Wisdom; that, in brief, Man was
                                      essentially one with Deity.With Simon, as with the Hermetic 
                                      philosophers of ancient Egypt, all things 
                                      were interrelated by correspondence, 
                                      analogy, and similitude. "As above, so 
                                      below," is the teaching on the Smaragdine 
                                      Table of Hermes. Therefore, whatever 
                                      happened to the divine Epinoia, the 
                                      Supreme Mother, among the Aeons, happened 
                                      also to the human Spiritual Soul or 
                                      Monadic Essence, in its evolution through 
                                      all stages of manifestation. This Soul is 
                                      shut into all forms and bodies, 
                                      successively up to the stage of man.From one point of view this teaching 
                                      has been conclusively proved by Modern 
                                      Science. The evolution of the external 
                                      form has been traced throughout all the 
                                      kingdoms and is no longer in question. The 
                                      ancient teachers of evolution, though less 
                                      exact in detail, were more accurate in 
                                      fact, in postulating a "something within" 
                                      which alone could make the external 
                                      evolution of form of any intelligible 
                                      purpose. The Spiritual Soul—the Life, 
                                      Consciousness, Spirit, Intelligence, 
                                      whatever we may choose to call it—was 
                                      formless in itself, but ever assuming new 
                                      forms by a process called metempsychosis, 
                                      metasomatosis, metangismos, etc., which in 
                                      the human stage becomes reïncarnation, the 
                                      rebirth or Punarjanman of the Hindûs.So much has been written on 
                                      metempsychosis and reïncarnation of late 
                                      that it is hardly necessary to dwell on a 
                                      now so familiar idea. In its widest sense 
                                      the whole process of nature is subject to 
                                      this mode of existence, and in its more 
                                      restricted sense it is the path of 
                                      pilgrimage of the Soul in the desert of 
                                      Matter. In treating of a philosophical 
                                      conception, which has already been 
                                      completely established as far as its 
                                      "visible side" is concerned by the 
                                      researches of Modern Science in the field 
                                      of evolution, it is a waste of time to 
                                      obscure the main issue by a rehashing of 
                                      the superstitious belief that the human 
                                      Soul might pass back to the brute. It may 
                                      be that this superstition arose from the 
                                      consideration that the body and lower 
                                      vestures of the Soul were shed off and 
                                      gradually absorbed by the lower creation 
                                      in the alchemical processes of nature. 
                                      This was the fate of the "Purgations" of 
                                      the Soul, but the Soul itself when once it 
                                      had passed from bodies of the lower 
                                      kingdoms, to bodies in the man-stage, 
                                      could not retrogress beyond the limits of 
                                      that human kingdom.By a glance at the Diagram, and 
                                      regarding it from the microcosmic point of 
                                      view, it is easy to see that the inner 
                                      nature of man is more complex than the 
                                      elementary trichotomy of Body, Soul, and 
                                      Spirit, might lead us to suppose. Each 
                                      plane of Being, for which the Soul has its 
                                      own appropriate Vesture, is generated from 
                                      an "indivisible point," as Simon called 
                                      it, a zero-point, to use a term of modern 
                                      Chemistry; six of which are shown in the 
                                      Diagram, and each plane of Being is 
                                      bounded by such zero-points, for they are 
                                      points like that of the Circle whose 
                                      centre is everywhere and circumference 
                                      nowhere.To pass on to the soteriology of Simon. 
                                      The general concept of this presents no 
                                      difficulty to the student of Eastern 
                                      Religions. The idea that the great 
                                      teachers are Avatâras, incarnations, or 
                                      descents, of the Supreme Being, appearing 
                                      on earth to aid mankind, is simple enough 
                                      to comprehend in itself, and would be open 
                                      to little objection, were it not for the 
                                      theological dogmas and mythological 
                                      legends that are wont to be so busily 
                                      woven round the lives of such teachers. In 
                                      the present age it is hardly necessary for 
                                      us, with the experience of the past before 
                                      our eyes, to raise dissension as to 
                                      whether such a manifestation is entirely 
                                      divine, or entirely human, or perfectly 
                                      human and divine at one and the same time, 
                                      or neither or all of these. Eastern philosophy, regarding not only 
                                      the external phenomenal world as 
                                      ever-changing and impermanent, but also 
                                      all appearance or manifestation—no matter 
                                      how subjective it may be to us now—as not 
                                      the one Truth in itself, which it claims 
                                      alone to be without change, it is easy to 
                                      see the reason why the Gnostic 
                                      Philosophers for the most part held to 
                                      Doceticism—that is to say that the body of 
                                      a Saviour was not the Saviour himself, but 
                                      an appearance. The heat of polemical 
                                      controversy may have led to exaggerated 
                                      views on both sides, but the philosophical 
                                      mind will not be distressed at the thought 
                                      that the body is an appearance or mask of 
                                      the real man, and that it forms no part of 
                                      his eternal possession. None the less the 
                                      body is real to us here, for we all have 
                                      bodies of a like nature, and appearances 
                                      are real to appearances. Yet this does not 
                                      invalidate the further consideration that 
                                      there are other bodies, vestures, or 
                                      vehicles of consciousness, besides the 
                                      gross physical "coat of skin," for the use 
                                      of the spiritual man, each being an 
                                      "appearance" in comparison to the higher 
                                      vehicle, which is in its turn an 
                                      "appearance" to that which is more subtle 
                                      and less material or substantial than 
                                      itself.Thus, in the descent from the Divine 
                                      World, the Soul transforms itself, or 
                                      clothes itself in forms, or bodies, or 
                                      vestures, which it weaves out of its own 
                                      substance, like to the Powers of the 
                                      Worlds it passes through, for every Soul 
                                      has a different vehicle of consciousness 
                                      for every World or Plane.But the doctrine of the Soter, or 
                                      Saviour, does not apply until the 
                                      Christ-stage or consummation is reached. 
                                      Following the idea of rebirth, there is a 
                                      spiritual life cycle, or life-thread, on 
                                      which the various earth-lives are strung, 
                                      as beads on a necklace, each successive 
                                      life being purer and nobler, as the Soul 
                                      gains control of matter, or the driver 
                                      control of the chariot and steeds that 
                                      speed him through the experiences of life. 
                                      As the end of this great cycle approaches, 
                                      an earthly vehicle is evolved that can 
                                      show forth the divine spirit in all the 
                                      fulness possible to this world or phase of 
                                      evolution.Now as the problem can be viewed from 
                                      either the internal or external point of 
                                      view, we have the mystery of the Soul 
                                      depicted both from the side of the 
                                      involution of spirit into matter and of 
                                      the evolution of matter into spirit. If, 
                                      on the one hand, we insist too strongly on 
                                      one view, we shall only have a one-sided 
                                      conception of the process; if, on the 
                                      other, we neglect one factor, we shall 
                                      never solve the at present unknown 
                                      quantity of the equation. Thus the Soul is 
                                      represented as the "lost sheep" struggling 
                                      in the meshes of the net of matter, 
                                      passing from body to body, and the Spirit 
                                      is represented as descending, transforming 
                                      itself through the spheres, in order to 
                                      finally rescue its Syzygy from the bonds 
                                      that are about her.The Soul aspires to the Spirit and the 
                                      Spirit takes thought for the Soul; as the 
                                      Simonians expressed it:When this mystery is represented 
                                      dramatically, so to say, and personified, 
                                      these two aspects of the Soul are depicted 
                                      as two persons. Thus we have Simon and 
                                      Helen, his favourite disciple, Krishna and 
                                      Arjuna, etc. In the Canonical Gospels the 
                                      favourite disciple is said to be John, and 
                                      the women-disciples are placed well in the 
                                      background. In the Gnostic Gospels, 
                                      however, the women-disciples are not so 
                                      ostracized, and the view taken by these 
                                      early communities of philosophical and 
                                      mystical Christians throws much light on 
                                      that wonderful history of the Magdalene 
                                      that has so touched the heart of 
                                      Christendom. For instance, in the 
                                      Pistis-Sophia, the chief of all the 
                                      disciples, the most spiritual and 
                                      intuitive, is Mary Magdalene. This is not 
                                      without significance when we remember the 
                                      love of the Christ for Mary "out of whom 
                                      he had cast seven devils."The allegory is a striking one, and 
                                      perfectly comprehensible to the student of 
                                      comparative religion. As there are seven 
                                      Aeons in the Spiritual World, seven 
                                      principles or aspects of the Spiritual 
                                      Soul, so here on Earth, by analogy, there 
                                      are seven lower aspects, or impure 
                                      reflections. As there are seven Cardinal 
                                      Virtues, the Prajnâ-Pâramitâs, or 
                                      Perfections of Wisdom, of the Buddhists, 
                                      so there are seven Cardinal Vices, and 
                                      these must be cast out by the spiritual 
                                      will, before the repentant Mary, or Human 
                                      Soul, can be purified.This is the mystery of the Helen, the 
                                      "lost sheep." Then follows the mystical 
                                      marriage of the Lamb, the union of the 
                                      Human and Spiritual Soul in man, referred 
                                      to so often in the Gospels and other 
                                      mystical scriptures.Naturally the language used is 
                                      symbolical, and has naught to do with sex, 
                                      in any sense. Woe unto him or her who 
                                      takes these allegories of the Soul as 
                                      literal histories, for nothing but sorrow 
                                      will follow such materialization of divine 
                                      mysteries. If Simon or his followers fell 
                                      into this error, they worked their own 
                                      downfall, under the Great Law, as surely 
                                      do all who forge such bonds of matter for 
                                      their own enslavement.But with condemnation we have nothing 
                                      to do; they alone who are without sin have 
                                      the right to cast stones at the 
                                      Magdalenes of this world; and they who are 
                                      truly without sin use their purity to 
                                      cleanse their fellows, and do not sully it 
                                      with the stains of self-righteous 
                                      condemnation. We, ordinary men and women 
                                      of the age, are all "lost sheep," human 
                                      souls struggling in ignorance; shall we 
                                      then stone our fellows because their 
                                      theology has a different nomenclature to 
                                      our own? For man was the same in the past 
                                      as he is to-day. The Human Soul has ever 
                                      the same hopes and fears, loves and hates, 
                                      passions and aspirations, no matter how 
                                      the mere form of their expression differs. 
                                      That which is important is the attitude we 
                                      hold to the forms with which we are 
                                      surrounded. To-day the form of our belief 
                                      is changed; the fashion of our dress is 
                                      scientific and not allegorical, but are we 
                                      any nearer the realization that it is a 
                                      dress and no more, and not the real 
                                      expression of the true man within?Let us now take a brief glance at the 
                                      Symbolical Tree of Life, which plays so 
                                      important a part in the Simonian Gnôsis. 
                                      Not, however, that it was peculiar to this 
                                      system, for several of the schools use the 
                                      same symbology. For instance, in the 
                                      Pistis-Sophia[130] 
                                      the idea is immensely expanded, and there 
                                      is much said of an Aeonian Hierarchy 
                                      called the Five Trees. As this, however, 
                                      may have been a later development, let us 
                                      turn to the ancient Hindû Shâstras, and 
                                      select one out of the many passages that 
                                      could be adduced, descriptive of the 
                                      Ashvattha Tree, the Tree of Life, "the 
                                      Ashvattha of golden wings," where the 
                                      bird-souls get their wings and fly away 
                                      happily, as the Sanatsujátîya tells 
                                      us. The passage we choose is from the 
                                      Bhagavad Gîtâ, that marvellous 
                                      philosophical episode from the 
                                      Mahâbhârata, which from internal 
                                      evidence, and at the very lowest estimate, 
                                      must be placed at a date anterior to 
                                      Simon. At the beginning of the fifteenth 
                                      Adyâya we read:For what is this "sword of detachment" 
                                      but another aspect of the "fiery sword" of 
                                      Simon, which is turned about to guard the 
                                      way to the Tree of Life? This "sword" is 
                                      our passions and desires, which now keep 
                                      us from the golden-leaved Tree of Life, 
                                      whence we may find wings to carry us to 
                                      the "Father in Heaven." For once we have 
                                      conquered Desire and turned it into 
                                      spiritual Will, it then becomes the "Sword 
                                      of Knowledge"; and the way to the Tree of 
                                      Spiritual Life being gained, the purified 
                                      Life becomes the "Wings of the Great Bird" 
                                      on which we mount, to be carried to its 
                                      Nest, where peace at last is found.The simile of the Tree is used in many 
                                      senses, not the least important of which 
                                      is that of the heavenly "vine" of the 
                                      reïncarnating Soul, every "life" of which 
                                      is a branch. This explains Simon's 
                                      citation of the Logion so familiar to us 
                                      in the Gospel according to Luke:This also explains one of the inner 
                                      meanings of the wonderful passage in the
                                      Gospel according to John:For only the spiritual fruit of every 
                                      life is harvested in the "Store-house" of 
                                      the Divine Soul; the rest is shed off to 
                                      be purified in the "Fire" of earthly 
                                      existence.Into the correspondence between the 
                                      world-process of Nature, and that which 
                                      takes place in the womb of mortal woman, 
                                      it will not be necessary to enter at 
                                      length. No doubt Simon taught many other 
                                      correspondences between the processes of 
                                      Cosmic Nature and Microcosmic Man, but 
                                      what were the details of this teaching we 
                                      can in no way be certain. Simon may have 
                                      made mistakes in physiology, according to 
                                      our present knowledge, but with the 
                                      evidence before us all we can do is to 
                                      suspend our judgment. For in the first 
                                      place, we do not know that he has been 
                                      correctly reported by his patristic 
                                      antagonists, and, in the second, we are 
                                      even yet too ignorant of the process of 
                                      the nourishment of the foetus to pronounce 
                                      any ex cathedrâ statement. In any 
                                      case Simon's explanation is more in 
                                      agreement with Modern Science than the 
                                      generality of the phantasies on scientific 
                                      subjects to which the uninstructed piety 
                                      of the early Fathers so readily lent 
                                      itself. As to whether the Initiated of the 
                                      ancients did or did not know of the 
                                      circulation of the blood and the functions 
                                      of the arterial system, we must remain in 
                                      doubt, for both their well known method of 
                                      concealing their knowledge and also the 
                                      absence of texts which may yet be 
                                      discovered by the industry of modern 
                                      exploration teach us to hold our judgment 
                                      in suspense.Again, seeing the importance which the 
                                      symbolical Tree played in the Simonian 
                                      System, it may be that there was an 
                                      esoteric teaching in the school, which 
                                      pointed out correspondences in the human 
                                      body for mystical purposes, as has been 
                                      the custom for long ages in India in the 
                                      Science of Yoga. In the human body are 
                                      at least two "Trees," the nervous, and 
                                      vascular systems. The former has its 
                                      "root" above in the cerebrum, the latter 
                                      has its roots in the heart. Along the 
                                      trunks and branches run currents of 
                                      "nervous ether" and "life" respectively, 
                                      and the Science of Yoga teaches its 
                                      disciples to use both of these forces for 
                                      mystical purposes. It is highly probable 
                                      also that the Gnostics taught the same 
                                      processes to their pupils, as we know for 
                                      a fact that the Neo-Platonists inculcated 
                                      like practices. From these considerations, 
                                      then, it may be supposed that Simon was 
                                      not so ignorant of the real laws of the 
                                      circulation of the blood as might 
                                      otherwise be imagined; and as to the 
                                      nourishment of the embryo, modern 
                                      authorities are at loggerheads, the 
                                      majority, however, inclining to the 
                                      opinion of Simon, that the foetus is 
                                      nourished through the umbilical cord.[132]The last point of importance to detain 
                                      us, before passing on to a notice on the 
                                      magical practices ascribed to Simon, is 
                                      the allegorical use made by the Simonians 
                                      of Scripture. Here again we have little to 
                                      do with the details reported, but only 
                                      with the idea. It was a common belief of 
                                      the sages of antiquity that the 
                                      mythological part of the sacred writings 
                                      of the nations were to be understood in an 
                                      allegorical fashion. Not to speak of 
                                      India, we have the Neo-Platonic School 
                                      with its analogetical methods of 
                                      interpretation, and the mention of a work 
                                      of Porphyry in which an allegorical 
                                      interpretation of the Iliad was 
                                      attempted. Allegorical shows of a similar 
                                      nature also were enacted in the Lesser 
                                      Mysteries and explained in the Greater, as 
                                      Julian tells us in the Mother of the 
                                      Gods,[133] 
                                      and Plutarch on the Cessation of 
                                      Oracles.[134]Much evidence could be adduced that 
                                      this was a widespread idea held by the 
                                      learned of antiquity, but space does not 
                                      here allow a full treatment of the 
                                      subject. What is important to note is that 
                                      Simon claimed this as a method of his 
                                      School, and therefore, in dealing with his 
                                      system, we cannot leave out so important a 
                                      factor, and persist in taking allegorical 
                                      and symbolical expressions as literal 
                                      teachings. We may say that the method is 
                                      misleading and has led to much 
                                      superstition among the ignorant, but we 
                                      have no right to criticize the literal and 
                                      historical meaning of an allegory, and 
                                      then fancy that we have criticized the 
                                      doctrine it enshrines. This has been the 
                                      error of all rationalistic critics of the 
                                      world bibles. They have wilfully set on 
                                      one side the whole method of ancient 
                                      religious teaching, and taken as literal 
                                      history and narrative what was essentially 
                                      allegorical and symbolical. Perhaps the 
                                      reason for this may be in the fact that 
                                      wherever religion decays and ignorance 
                                      spreads herself, there the symbolical and 
                                      allegorical is materialized into the 
                                      historical and literal. The spirit is 
                                      forgotten, the letter is deified. Hence 
                                      the reäction of the rationalistic critic 
                                      against the materialism and literalism of 
                                      sacred verities. Nevertheless, such 
                                      criticism does not go deep enough to 
                                      affect the real truths of religion and the 
                                      convictions of the human soul, any more 
                                      than an aesthetic criticism on the shape 
                                      of the Roman letters and Arabic figures 
                                      can affect the truth of an algebraical 
                                      formula. Rationalistic criticism may stir 
                                      people from literalism and dogmatic 
                                      crystallization, in fact it has done much 
                                      in this way, but it does not reach the 
                                      hidden doctrines.Now Simon contended that many of the 
                                      narrations of Scripture were allegorical, 
                                      and opposed those who held to the 
                                      dead-letter interpretation. To the student 
                                      of comparative religion, it is difficult 
                                      to see what is so highly blameworthy in 
                                      this. On the contrary, this view is so 
                                      worthy of praise, that it deserves to be 
                                      widely adopted to-day, at the latter end 
                                      of the nineteenth century. To understand 
                                      antiquity, we must follow the methods of 
                                      the wise among the ancients, and the 
                                      method of allegory and parable was the 
                                      manner of teaching of the great Masters of 
                                      the past.But supposing we grant this, and admit 
                                      that all Scriptures possess an inner 
                                      meaning and lend themselves to 
                                      interpretation on every plane of being and 
                                      thought, who is to decide whether any 
                                      particular interpretation is just or no? 
                                      Already we have writers arising, giving 
                                      diametrically opposite interpretations of 
                                      the same mystical narrative, and though 
                                      this may be an advance on bald physical 
                                      literalism, it is by no means encouraging 
                                      to the instructed and philosophical mind.If the Deity is no respecter of 
                                      persons, times, or nations, and if no age 
                                      is left without witness of the Divine, it 
                                      would seem to be in accordance with the 
                                      fitness of things that all religions in 
                                      their purity are one in essence, no matter 
                                      how overgrown with error they may have 
                                      become through the ignorance of man. If, 
                                      again, the root of true Religion is one, 
                                      and the nature of the Soul and of the 
                                      inner constitution of things is identical 
                                      in all climes and times, as far as its 
                                      main features are concerned, no matter 
                                      what terminology, allegory, and symbology 
                                      may be employed to describe it; and not 
                                      only this, but if it be true that such 
                                      subjective things are as potent facts in 
                                      human consciousness as any that exist, as 
                                      indeed is evidenced by the unrivalled 
                                      influence such things have had on human 
                                      hearts and actions throughout the history 
                                      of the world—then we must consider that an 
                                      interpretation that fits only one system 
                                      and is found entirely unsuitable to the 
                                      rest, is no part of universal religion, 
                                      and is due rather to the ingenuity of the 
                                      interpreter than to a discovery of any law 
                                      of subjective nature. The method of 
                                      comparative religion alone can give us any 
                                      certainty of correct interpretation, and a 
                                      refusal to institute such a comparison 
                                      should invalidate the reliability of all 
                                      such enquiries.Now Simon is reported to have 
                                      endeavoured to find an inner meaning in 
                                      scriptural narratives and mythologies, and 
                                      against this method we can have nothing to 
                                      say; it is only when a man twists the 
                                      interpretation to suit his own prejudices 
                                      that danger arises. Simon, however, is 
                                      shown to have appealed to the various 
                                      sacred literatures known in his time, an 
                                      eclectic and theosophical method, and one 
                                      that cannot very well be longer set on one 
                                      side even in our own days.The primitive church was not so 
                                      forgetful of symbology as are the majority 
                                      of the Christian faith to-day. One of the 
                                      commonest representations of primitive 
                                      Christian art was that of the "Four 
                                      Rivers." As the Rev. Professor Cheetham 
                                      tells us:The interpretations given by the early 
                                      divines were many and various; in nearly 
                                      every case, however, it was an 
                                      interpretation which applied to the 
                                      Christian system alone, and accentuated 
                                      external differences. Little attempt was 
                                      made to find an interpretation in nature, 
                                      either objective or subjective, or in man. 
                                      Simon, at any rate, made the attempt—an 
                                      effort to broaden out into a universal 
                                      system applying to all men at all times. 
                                      This is also the real spirit of pure 
                                      Christianity which is so often 
                                      over-clouded by theological partisanship. 
                                      A true interpretation must stand the test 
                                      of not only religious aspiration, but also 
                                      philosophical thought and scientific 
                                      observation.Nor again should we find cause to 
                                      grieve at an attempted interpretation of 
                                      the Trojan Horse, that was fabricated by 
                                      the advice of Athena (Minerva-Epinoia), 
                                      for did not George Stanley Faber, in the 
                                      early years of this century, labour with 
                                      much learning to prove its identity with 
                                      the Ark. True he only turned similar myths 
                                      into the terms of one myth and got no 
                                      further, but that was an advance on his 
                                      immediate predecessors. Simon, however, 
                                      had centuries before gone further than 
                                      Faber, as far as theory is concerned, by 
                                      seeking an interpretation in nature. But, 
                                      in his turn, as far as our records go, he 
                                      only attempted the interpretation of one 
                                      aspect of this graphic symbol, saying that 
                                      it typified "ignorance." An 
                                      interpretation, however, to be complete 
                                      should cover all planes of consciousness 
                                      and being from the physical human plane to 
                                      the divine cosmic. The Ark floating on the 
                                      Waters of the Deluge and containing the 
                                      Germs of Life, the Mundane Egg in the 
                                      Waters of Space, and the Mare with her 
                                      freight of armed warriors, all typify a 
                                      great fact in nature, which may be studied 
                                      scientifically in the development of the 
                                      germ-cell, and ethically by analogy, as 
                                      the egg of ignorance, the germs in which 
                                      are, from the lower aspect, our own evil 
                                      passions.In speaking of such allegories and 
                                      tracing the correspondences between 
                                      certain symbologies and the natural facts 
                                      of embryology, Simon speaks of the "cave" 
                                      which plays so important a part in so many 
                                      religious allegories. As the child is born 
                                      in a "cave," so the "new man" is also born 
                                      in a "cave," and all the Saviours are so 
                                      recorded to have been born in their birth 
                                      legends. The Mysteries of antiquity were 
                                      for the most part solemnized in caves, or 
                                      rock-cut temples. The Epoptæ deemed such 
                                      caverns as symbols both of the physical 
                                      world and Hades or the Unseen World, which 
                                      surrounds every child of man. Into such a 
                                      cave, in the middle of the Ocean, Cronus 
                                      shut his children, as Porphyry[136] 
                                      tells us. It was called by the name Petra, 
                                      or Rock, and from such a Rock Mithras is 
                                      said to have been born.[137]Faber endeavours to identify this 
                                      symbolical cave with the Ark,[138] 
                                      which may be permissible from one aspect, 
                                      as the womb of mother nature and of the 
                                      human mother correspond analogically.In the "new birth" of the mysteries, 
                                      the Souls were typified as bees born from 
                                      the body of an ox, for they were to gather 
                                      the honey of wisdom, and were born from 
                                      the now dead body of their lower natures. 
                                      In the cave were two doors, one for 
                                      immortals, the other for mortals. In this 
                                      connection the cave is the psychic womb 
                                      that surrounds every man, of which 
                                      Nicodemus displays such ignorance in the 
                                      Gospels. It is the microcosmic Middle 
                                      Distance; by one door the Lower Soul 
                                      enters, and uniting with its immortal 
                                      consort, who descends through the door of 
                                      the immortals, becomes immortal.The cavern is overshadowed by an olive 
                                      tree—again the Tree of Life to which we 
                                      have referred above—on the branches of 
                                      which the doves rest, and bring back the 
                                      leaves to the ark of the body and the 
                                      prisoner within it.But space does not permit us to pursue 
                                      further this interesting subject, which 
                                      requires an entire treatise by itself, or 
                                      even a series of volumes. Enough, however, 
                                      has been said to show that the method of 
                                      interpretation employed by Simon is not 
                                      without interest and profit, and that the 
                                      tolerant spirit of to-day which animates 
                                      the best minds and hearts in Christendom 
                                      will find no reason to mete out to Simon 
                                      wholesale condemnation on this score.There are also many other points of 
                                      interest that could be elaborated upon, in 
                                      the fragments of the system we are 
                                      reviewing, but as my task is in the form 
                                      of an essay, and not an exhaustive work, I 
                                      must be content to pass them by for the 
                                      present, and to hurry on to a few words on 
                                      that strange and misunderstood subject, 
                                      commonly known as Magic.What Magic, the "Great Art" of the 
                                      ancients, was in reality is now as 
                                      difficult to discover as is the true 
                                      Religion that underlies all the great 
                                      religions of the world. It was an art, a 
                                      practice, the Great and Supreme Art of the 
                                      most Sacred Science of God, the Universe 
                                      and Man. It was and it is all this in its 
                                      highest sense, and its method was what is 
                                      now called "creation." As the Aeons 
                                      imitated the Boundless Power and emanated 
                                      or created in their turn, so could man 
                                      imitate the Aeons and emanate or create in 
                                      his turn. But "creation" is not 
                                      generation, it is a work of the "mind," in 
                                      the highest sense of the word. By 
                                      purification and aspiration, by prayer and 
                                      fasting, man had to make his mind 
                                      harmonious with the Great Mind of the 
                                      Universe, and so by imitation create pure 
                                      vehicles whereby his consciousness could 
                                      be carried in every direction of the 
                                      Universe. Such spiritual operations 
                                      required the greatest purity and piety, 
                                      real purity and true piety, without 
                                      disguise or subterfuge, for man had to 
                                      face himself and his God, before whom no 
                                      disguise was possible. The most secret 
                                      motives, the most hidden desires, were 
                                      revealed by the stern self-discipline to 
                                      which the Adepts of the Science subjected 
                                      themselves.But as in all things here below, so 
                                      with the Art of Magic, it was two-fold. 
                                      Above I have only spoken of the bright 
                                      side of it, the path along which the 
                                      World-Saviours have trodden, for no one 
                                      can gain entrance to the path of 
                                      self-sacrifice and compassion unless his 
                                      heart burns with love for all that lives, 
                                      and unless he treads the way of wisdom 
                                      only in order that he may become that Path 
                                      itself for the salvation of the race. But 
                                      there is the other side; knowledge is 
                                      knowledge irrespective of the use to which 
                                      it may be put. The sword of knowledge is 
                                      two-edged, as remarked above, and may be 
                                      put to good or evil use, according to the 
                                      selfishness or unselfishness of the 
                                      possessor.But corruptio optimi pessima, 
                                      and as the employment of wisdom for the 
                                      benefit of mankind—as, for instance, 
                                      curing the sick, physically and morally—is 
                                      the highest, so the use of any abnormal 
                                      power for the advantage of self is the 
                                      vilest sin that man can commit.There are strange analogies in Nature, 
                                      and the higher the spiritual, the lower 
                                      the corresponding material process; so 
                                      that we find in the history of 
                                      magic—perhaps the longest history in the 
                                      world—extremes ever meeting. Abuse of 
                                      spiritual powers, and the vilest physical 
                                      processes, noxious, fantastic, and 
                                      pestilential, are recorded in the pages of 
                                      so-called magical literature, but such 
                                      foul deeds are no more real Magic than are 
                                      the horrors of religious fanaticism the 
                                      outcome of true Mohammedanism or 
                                      Christianity. This is the abuse, the 
                                      superstition, the degeneration of all that 
                                      is good and true, rendered all the more 
                                      vile because it pertains to denser planes 
                                      of matter than even the physical. It is a 
                                      strange thing that the highest should pair 
                                      with the lowest where man is concerned, 
                                      but it ever remains true that the higher 
                                      we climb the lower we may fall.Man is much the same in nature at all 
                                      times, and though the Art was practised in 
                                      its purity by the great World-Teachers and 
                                      their immediate followers, whether we call 
                                      it by the name Magic or no, it ever fell 
                                      into abuse and degeneracy owing to the 
                                      ingrained ignorance and selfishness of 
                                      man. Thus the Deity and Gods or Daemons of 
                                      one nation became the Devil and Demons of 
                                      another; the names were changed, the facts 
                                      remained the same. For if we are to reject 
                                      all such things as superstition, 
                                      hallucination, and what not, the good must 
                                      go with the bad. But facts, whether good 
                                      or bad, are still facts, and man is still 
                                      man, no matter how he changes the fashion 
                                      of his belief. The followers of the 
                                      World-Teachers cannot hold to the 
                                      so-called "miracles" of their respective 
                                      Masters and reject all others as false in 
                                      fact, no matter from what source they may 
                                      believe they emanate. In nature there can 
                                      be nothing supernatural, and as man stands 
                                      mid-way between the divine and infernal, 
                                      if we accept the energizing of the one 
                                      side of his nature, we must also accept 
                                      that of the other. Both are founded on 
                                      nature and science, both are under law and 
                                      order.The great Master of Christendom is 
                                      reported to have told his disciples that 
                                      if they had but faith they should do 
                                      greater works than even he had done. 
                                      Either this was false or else the 
                                      followers have been false to their 
                                      Teacher. There is no escape from the 
                                      dilemma. And such "works" are to be 
                                      wrought by divine Magic alone, or if the 
                                      term be disliked, by whatever name the 
                                      great Science of the Soul and Divine 
                                      things may be called.For the last two hundred years or so it 
                                      has been the fashion to deride all such 
                                      matters, perhaps owing to a reäction 
                                      against over-credulity on the part of 
                                      those who held to the letter of the law 
                                      and forgot its spirit; but to-day it is no 
                                      longer possible to entirely set aside this 
                                      all-important part of man's nature, and it 
                                      now calls for as strict a scientific 
                                      treatment as the facts of the physical 
                                      universe have been subjected to.Hypnotism, Mesmerism, Spiritualism and 
                                      Psychical Research, are the cloud no 
                                      bigger than a man's hand that is forcing 
                                      the facts of Magic again on the attention 
                                      of both the theological and scientific 
                                      world. Hypnotism and Psychical Research 
                                      are already becoming respectable and 
                                      attracting the attention of the generality 
                                      of men of science and of our clergy. 
                                      Spiritualism and Mesmerism are still 
                                      tabooed, but wait their turn for popular 
                                      recognition, having already been 
                                      recognized by pioneers distinguished in 
                                      science and other professions.Of course I speak only of the facts of 
                                      these arts, I do not speak of the theories 
                                      put forward.All these processes are in the very 
                                      outermost court of the Temple of True 
                                      Magic, even if they are not outside the 
                                      precinct. But they are sufficient for our 
                                      purpose, and should make the serious 
                                      thinker and unprejudiced enquirer pause 
                                      before pronouncing the words, superstition 
                                      and hallucination, in too confident a 
                                      tone, for he now must see the necessity of 
                                      having a clear idea of what he means by 
                                      the terms.It is not uncommon of late to hear the 
                                      superficially instructed setting down 
                                      everything to "suggestion," a word they 
                                      have picked up from modern hypnotic 
                                      research, or "telepathy," a name invented 
                                      by psychical research—the ideas being as 
                                      old as the world—forgetting that their 
                                      mind remains in precisely the same 
                                      attitude with regard to such matters as it 
                                      was in previously when they utterly denied 
                                      the possibility of suggestion and 
                                      telepathy. But to the earnest and patient 
                                      student hypnotism and the rest are but the 
                                      public reäppearance of what has always 
                                      existed in spite of the denial of two 
                                      hundred years or so, and instead of 
                                      covering the whole ground is but the 
                                      forward spray from the returning wave of 
                                      psychism which will sweep the nations off 
                                      their feet and moral balance, if they will 
                                      not turn to the experience of the past and 
                                      gain strength to withstand the inrush.The higher forms of all these things, 
                                      in the Western World, should have now been 
                                      in the hands of the ministers of the 
                                      Church, in which case we should not have 
                                      had the reäppearance of such powers in the 
                                      hands of vulgar stage exhibitions and 
                                      mercenary public mediumship.But so it is; and in vain is it any 
                                      longer to raise the cry of fraud and 
                                      hallucination on the one hand and of the 
                                      devil on the other. This is a mere 
                                      shirking of responsibility, and nothing 
                                      but a reasonable investigation and an 
                                      insistence on the highest ideals of life 
                                      will help humanity.I do not intend to enter into any 
                                      review of the "wonders" attributed to 
                                      Simon, neither to deny them as 
                                      hallucinations, nor attribute them to the 
                                      devil, nor explain them away by 
                                      "suggestion." As a matter of fact we do 
                                      not even know whether Simon did or 
                                      pretended to do any of the precise things 
                                      mentioned. All we are competent to decide 
                                      is the general question, viz., that any 
                                      use of abnormal power is pernicious if 
                                      done for a personal motive, and will 
                                      assuredly, sooner or later, react on the 
                                      doer.Here and there in the patristic 
                                      accounts we light on a fact worthy of 
                                      consideration, as, for example, when Simon 
                                      is reported to have denied that the real 
                                      soul of a boy could be exorcised, and said 
                                      that it was only a daemon, in this case a 
                                      sub-human intelligence or elemental, as 
                                      the Mediæval Kabalists called them. Again 
                                      the Simonians are said to have expelled 
                                      any from their Mysteries who worshipped 
                                      the statues of Zeus or Athena as being 
                                      representatives of Simon and Helen; thus 
                                      showing that they were symbolical figures 
                                      for some purpose other than ordinary 
                                      worship; and probably the sect in its 
                                      purity possessed a body of teaching which 
                                      threw light on many of the religious 
                                      practices of the times, and gave them a 
                                      rational interpretation, quite at variance 
                                      with the fantastic diabolism which the 
                                      Fathers have so loudly charged against 
                                      them.The legends of magic are the same in 
                                      all countries, fantastic enough to us in 
                                      the nineteenth century, in all conscience, 
                                      and most probably exaggerated out of all 
                                      correct resemblance to facts by the 
                                      excited imagination of the legend-tellers, 
                                      but still it is not all imagination, and 
                                      after sifting out even ninety-nine per 
                                      cent of rubbish, the residue that remains 
                                      is such vast evidence to the main facts 
                                      that it is fairly overwhelming, and 
                                      deserves the investigation of every honest 
                                      student.But the study is beset with great 
                                      difficulty, and if left in the hands of 
                                      untrained thinkers, as are the majority of 
                                      those who are interested in such matters 
                                      in the present day, will only result in a 
                                      new phase of credulity and superstition. 
                                      And such a disastrous state of affairs 
                                      will be the distinct fault of the leaders 
                                      of thought in the religious, 
                                      philosophical, and scientific world, if 
                                      they refuse the task which is naturally 
                                      theirs, and if they are untrue to the 
                                      responsibility of their position as the 
                                      directors, guardians, and adjusters of the 
                                      popular mind. Denial is useless, mere 
                                      condemnation is of small value, 
                                      explanation alone will meet the 
                                      difficulty.Thus when we are brought face to face 
                                      with the recital of magical wonders as 
                                      attributed to Simon in the patristic 
                                      legends, it is not sufficient to sweep 
                                      them on one side and ticket them with the 
                                      contemptuous label of "superstition." We 
                                      must recognize that whether or not these 
                                      things were actually done by Simon, the 
                                      ancient world both Pagan and Christian 
                                      firmly believed in their reality, and that 
                                      if our only attitude towards them is one 
                                      of blank denial, we include in that denial 
                                      the possibility of the so-called 
                                      "miracles" of Christianity and other great 
                                      religions, and therewith invalidate one of 
                                      the most important factors of religious 
                                      thought and history. That the present 
                                      attitude of denial is owing to the absurd 
                                      explanation of the phenomena given by the 
                                      majority of the ancient worthies, is 
                                      easily admissible, but this is no reason 
                                      why the denial of the possibilities of the 
                                      existence of such things should be logical 
                                      or scientific.As to the wonders ascribed to Simon, 
                                      though extraordinary, they are puerile 
                                      compared to the ideals of the truly 
                                      religious mind, and if Simon used such 
                                      marvels as proofs of the truth of his 
                                      doctrine, he unduly took advantage of the 
                                      ignorance of the populace and was untrue 
                                      to his better nature.Again, setting aside all historical 
                                      criticism, if Simon, as the Acts 
                                      report, thought to purchase spiritual 
                                      powers with money, or that those who were 
                                      really in possession of such powers would 
                                      ever sell them, we can understand the 
                                      righteous indignation of the apostles, 
                                      though we cannot understand their cursing 
                                      a brother-man. The view of the Christian 
                                      writer on this point is a true one, but 
                                      the dogma that every operation which is 
                                      not done in the name of the particular 
                                      Master of Christendom is of the Devil—or, 
                                      to avoid personifications, is evil—can 
                                      hardly find favour with those who believe 
                                      in the brotherhood of the whole race and 
                                      that Deity is one, no matter under what 
                                      form worshipped.Finally, to sum up the matter, we have 
                                      cited our authorities, and reviewed them, 
                                      and then endeavoured to sift out what is 
                                      good from the heap, leaving the rubbish to 
                                      its fate. Removed as we are by so many 
                                      centuries from the fierce strife of 
                                      religious controversy which so deeply 
                                      marked the rise of Christianity, we can 
                                      view the matter with impartiality and seek 
                                      to redress the errors that are patent both 
                                      on the side of orthodoxy and of 
                                      heterodoxy. It is true we cannot be free 
                                      of the past, but it is also true that to 
                                      identify ourselves with the hates and 
                                      strifes of the ancients, is merely to 
                                      retrogress from the path of progress. On 
                                      the contrary, our duty should be to 
                                      identify ourselves with all that is good 
                                      and beautiful and true in the past, and so 
                                      gleaning it together, bind it into a sheaf 
                                      of corn that, when ground in the mills of 
                                      common-sense and practical experience, may 
                                      feed the millions of every denomination 
                                      who for the most part are starving on the 
                                      unsatisfying husks of crude dogmatism. 
                                      There is no need for a new revelation, in 
                                      whatever sense the word is understood, but 
                                      there is every need for an explanation of 
                                      the old revelations and the undeniable 
                                      facts of human experience. If the Augean 
                                      stables of the materialism that is so 
                                      prevalent in the religion, philosophy and 
                                      science of to-day, are to be cleansed, the 
                                      spiritual sources of the world-religions 
                                      can alone be effectual for their 
                                      cleansing, but these are at present hidden 
                                      by the rocks and overgrowth of dogma and 
                                      ignorance. And this overgrowth can only be 
                                      removed by explanation and investigation, 
                                      and each who works at the task is, 
                                      consciously or unconsciously, in the train 
                                      of the Hercules who is pioneering the 
                                      future of humanity.

                                        Book of Hermes Trismegistus, called "His 
                                        Crater, or Monas," as follows: "10. Tat. But wherefore, 
                                        Father, did not God distribute the Mind 
                                        to all men? "11. Herm. Because it pleased 
                                        him, O Son, to set that in the middle 
                                        among all souls, as a reward to strive 
                                        for. "12. Tat. And where hath he 
                                        set it? "13. Herm. Filling a large Cup 
                                        or Bowl (Crater) therewith, he sent it 
                                        down, giving also a Cryer or Proclaimer.
                                        "14. And he commanded him to proclaim 
                                        these things to the souls of men. "15. Dip and wash thyself, thou that 
                                        art able, in this Cup or Bowl: Thou that 
                                        believeth that thou shalt return to him 
                                        that sent this cup; thou that 
                                        acknowledgest whereunto thou wert made.
                                        "16. As many, therefore, as 
                                        understood the Proclamation, and were 
                                        baptized, or dowsed into the Mind, 
                                        these were made partakers of knowledge, 
                                        and became perfect men, receiving the 
                                        Mind." This striking passage explains the 
                                        mystic "Baptism of Fire," or Mind, 
                                        whereby man became one with his Divine 
                                        Monas, which is indeed his "Mother 
                                        Vortex" or Source.
