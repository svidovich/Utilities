 Pistis Sophia
translated by G. S. R. MeadJesus addresseth them.And it came to pass then, when the disciples saw this, that they feared exceedingly, and were in agitation. Then Jesus, the compassionate and tender-hearted, when he saw his disciples, that they were in great agitation, spake with them, saying: "Take courage. It is I, be not afraid."Return to the Gnostic Society Library
