 Pistis Sophia
translated by G. S. R. MeadIt came to pass then, when the First Mystery had finished saying these words unto the disciples, that he said: "Who hath understood the words which I have spoken, let him come forward and set forth their solution."James came forward and said: "My Lord, concerning this song which Pistis Sophia hath sung, thus thy light-power hath prophesied aforetime through David in the seventh Psalm:James interpreteth the song from Psalm vii."'1. O Lord, my God, in thee have I hoped. Free me from my pursuers and save me,"'2. That in sooth he may never steal away my soul as a lion, without any one to deliver and save."'3. O Lord, my God, if I have done this, if injustice is on my hands,"'4. If I have requited those who requite me with evil, then let me fall down empty through my foes."'5. And let the foe pursue after my soul and seize it, and trample my life to the ground and lay my honour in the dust. (Selah.)"'6. Arise, O Lord, in thy wrath, raise thyself up for the end of my foes."'7. Arise according to the commandment which thou hast commanded.'" |173.It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had heard James speak these words, that he said: "Well said, James, beloved."Return to the Gnostic Society Library
