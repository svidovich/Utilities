 Pistis Sophia
translated by G. S. R. MeadThe second repentance of Sophia.Jesus continued again in the discourse and said: "Pistis Sophia again continued and still sang praises in a second repentance, saying thus:"'1. Light of lights, in whom I have had faith, leave me not in the darkness until the end of my time."'2. Help me and save me through thy mysteries; incline thine ear unto me and save me."'3. May the power of thy light save me and carry me to the higher æons; for thou wilt save me and lead me into the height of thy æons."'4. Save me, O Light, from the hand of this lion-faced power and from the hands of the emanations of god Self-willed."'5. For it is thou, O Light, in whose light I have had faith and in whose light I have trusted from the beginning."'6. And I have had faith in it from the time when it emanated me, and thou thyself didst make me to emanate; and I have had faith in thy light from the beginning.p. 46"'7. And when I had faith in thee, the rulers of the æons mocked at me, saying: She hath ceased in her mystery. Thou art |57. my saviour and thou art my deliverer and thou art my mystery, O Light."'8. My mouth was filled with glorifying, that I may tell of the mystery of thy grandeur at all times."'9. Now, therefore, O Light, leave me not in the chaos for the completion of my whole time; forsake me not, O Light."'10. For all the emanations of Self-willed have taken from me my whole light-power and have surrounded me. They desired to take away my whole light from me utterly and have set a watch on my power,"'11. Saying one to another together: The Light hath forsaken her, let us seize her and take away the whole light in her."'12. Therefore then, O Light, cease not from me; turn thee, O Light, and save me from the hands of the merciless."'13. May they who would take away my power, fall down and become powerless. May they who would take away my light-power from me, be enwrapped in darkness and sink into powerlessness.'"This then is the second repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, singing praises to the Light."Return to the Gnostic Society Library
