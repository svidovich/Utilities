      volumes, drawn from, or based upon, the mystic, theosophic and gnostic 
      writings of the ancients, so as to make more easily audible for the 
      ever-widening circle of those who love such things, some echoes of the 
      mystic experiences and initiatory lore of their spiritual ancestry. There 
      are many who love the life of the spirit, and who long for the light of 
      gnostic illumination, but who are not sufficiently equipped to study the 
      writings of the ancients at first hand, or to follow unaided the labours 
      of scholars. These little volumes are therefore intended to serve as 
      introduction to the study of the more difficult literature of the subject; 
      and it is hoped that at the same time they may become for some, who have, 
      as yet, not even heard of the Gnosis, stepping-stones to higher things.G. R. S. M.THE VISION OF ARIDÆUS___________CONTENTSPTC___________The text used is that of Bernardakis, published in the 
      Bibliotheca Teubneriana series (Leipzig; 1891).pg 8 THE VISION OF PREAMBLE. The Story of Aridæus is the most detailed and graphic Vision of Hades 
      preserved to us from classical antiquity, and exceeds in interest even 
      Plato’s Story of Er and Cicero’s Dream of Scipio, not to speak of the less 
      known Visions of Krates and of Zosimus.It brings to a striking conclusion the instructive treatise of 
      Plutarch, the Greek title of which may be rendered, On the Delay of the 
      Deity in Punishing the Wicked or On the Delay of Divine Justice.Plutarch of Chæroneia, in Bœotia, flourished in the last quarter of the 
      second century (? 50-120 A.D.). He was one of the 
      most enlightened of the ancients, exceedingly pg 9well versed in the details of the religious philosophies and the 
      sciences of his day, and possessed of good critical abilities; he was also 
      a man of wide religious experience, holding high office at Delphi in the 
      service of Apollo and also in connection with the Dionysiac Rites, and had 
      a profound knowledge of the inner grades of the Osiric Mysteries. He was 
      educated in Athens and Alexandria and lectured at Rome.Plutarch is one of our most valuable sources of information on the 
      Hellenic and Hellenistic theology, theosophy and mystagogy of the first 
      century, and is therefore indispensable in any comparative study of the 
      Gnosis.Our philosopher has been variously styled a Platonist, Neo-platonist, 
      Eclectic, Ethicist and Syncretist; but it is very difficult to label 
      Plutarch precisely, for as Dr. John Oakesmith, in his instructive essay,
      The Religion of Plutarch: A Pagan Creed of Apostolic Times (London; 
      1902), pg 10says, he "suggested a frame of mind rather than inculcated a body of 
      dogma." He was in some ways a very good specimen of what we ought to mean 
      to day by the term theosophist.Though there is not a single word in the whole of his voluminous 
      writings to show that he was acquainted with Christianity, it has 
      nevertheless been argued that he must have derived his ethics and 
      monotheistic ideas from Christianity; and, curiously enough, Dr. Charles 
      Super, in his Between Heathenism and Christianity (Chicago; 1889), 
      selects the very treatise of Plutarch’s which contains our Vision 
      (together with Seneca’s Concerning Providence), to demonstrate the 
      intimate points of contact between the religio-philosophy of the time and 
      the New Religion.We have, however, shown at length in the Prolegomena of Thrice 
      Greatest Hermes that the doctrines of Hellenistic theology, theosophy 
      and gnosis were widespread in the first century, and had in many ways pg 11a common language with the books of the New Testament writers; there 
      is, however, no question of direct plagiarism on either side.The Vision of Aridæus is of interest in many ways, and doubtless that 
      interest would be increased for us if we could be persuaded with Count 
      Joseph de Maistre, that "it is permissible to believe that Dante took the 
      general idea of his Inferno" from the description of the punishments in 
      our Vision, as de Maistre writes in his translation of the treatise 
      (Paris; 1856). I must, however, leave the suggestion to Dante scholars, 
      with the remark that it is now proved, especially by the work of Dr. J. E. 
      Sandys, that the Renaissance of classical studies began, long before the 
      capture of Constantinople, in the days of Petrarch and Boccaccio.Concerning the source and composition of the Vision, and how Plutarch 
      intended us to take it, as many opinions may be held as in the case of the 
      better-known pg 12Vision of � r in Plato. I 
      would, however, myself suggest that the key to the situation is to be 
      found in the following passage of our philosopher-mystagogue:"When a man dies he goes through the same experiences as those who have 
      their consciousness increased in the Mysteries. Thus in the terms
      teleut©n (‘to die’) and 
      tele‹sqai (‘to be initiated’) we have an exact correspondence, word 
      to word and fact to fact."First of all there are wanderings and wearying journeyings and paths 
      on which we look with suspicion, and that seem to have no end; then, 
      before the end, every kind of terror, shuddering, trembling, sweating, 
      stupor."But at last a marvellous light shines out to meet us, pure spots and 
      far fields welcome us, with song and dance and the solemnities of sacred 
      sounds and holy sights."In which state he who has already perfected himself in all things and 
      received pg 13initiation, reaches his full freedom, and passing everywhere at will, 
      receives the crown, and accomplishes his mystery, in communion with the 
      holy and pure; gazing down upon the unpurified multitude of the 
      uninitiated who are still in life, wallowing in the deep mire and mist, 
      and herded together below him, abiding in misery from fear of death and 
      want of faith in the blessedness of the soul-life."For you should know that the intercourse and conjunction of the soul 
      with body is contrary to nature." (Plut., Fragm. v. 9, ed. Didot).The further consideration of this suggestion, however, will more 
      conveniently come later, when the reader has become acquainted with the 
      Vision.The treatise is in the form of a Platonic dialogue. The persons of the 
      dialogue are: Plutarch himself, who is the chief speaker; Patrocleas, his 
      son-in-law; Timon, his brother; and Olympichus, an intimate friend. The 
      scene is the Portico pg 14of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. The tract is addressed to a certain 
      Quintus, who must have been a Roman, but of whom nothing further is known.In the course of his argument, Plutarch remarks that no punishment is 
      more distressing and makes us more ashamed than to see our children 
      suffering through our misdeeds. And if the soul of an impious law-breaker 
      could after death see his children or friends or family in great adversity 
      because of him and paying the penalty of his misdeeds, no one would ever 
      be able to persuade him, even for the wealth of Zeus, to be unjust or 
      licentious again on his return to earth."I could tell you a true story (logos) which I lately heard," he 
      continues, "but I’m afraid you would think it a tale (mythos); I 
      therefore confine myself to probability only."As, however, the others pressed for the story, Plutarch replied: 
      "Permit me first to finish the argument as to probabilities, pg 15and then, if you like, I will set the tale going, if indeed it be a 
      tale."Plutarch here evidently intends it to be understood that for him the 
      story is logos and not mythos; and by logos he means 
      as evidently that it is based on "fact" and not "probability."This is plain from his own words, and is further strengthened by the 
      general use at that date of the word logos for a serious narrative, 
      especially a "sacred discourse," or a story of initiation.It is further of interest to note that Plato at the end of his story of 
      the Vision of Er refers to it as a mythos. Can Plutarch have had 
      this in mind, and does he wish to draw a distinction between his 
      "logos" and the famous "myth" of Plato?It is more than probable that the myths of Plato had been frequently 
      discussed in the schools, and that there were very various opinions as to 
      how they were to be taken; the term myth had fallen into disrepute 
      among the learned, and Plutarch pg 16here as elsewhere uses logos as a better description of a 
      narrative connected with the doctrines of initiation.Plutarch tells us that the hero of his story was a certain Aridæus of 
      Soli, a town on the sea-coast of Asia Minor; he was an intimate friend of 
      Protogenes of Tarsus (Plut., On Love, ii.) who stayed with Plutarch 
      for some time at Delphi. Aridæus related his experiences to Protogenes and 
      other intimate friends; and so we may suppose that Plutarch first heard 
      the story from Protogenes, and finding it somewhat in keeping with what he 
      himself had been taught, or seen dramatically represented, in one or other 
      of the initiatory-rites through which he had passed, he polished it up and 
      amplified it to suit his purpose.This Aridæus had lived a notorious life of great profligacy and 
      villainy; he was a sort of millionaire scoundrel of the period. Report had 
      it that on his sending to ask the Oracle of Amphilochus, at Mallus in 
      Cilicia, whether there was pg 17any chance of his living a better life for the rest of his days, he 
      received the reply that he would do better when he was dead.Shortly after, Aridæus had a severe fall, and though he broke no bones, 
      the shock did for him. Three days later, just as they were about to bury 
      him, he recovered consciousness. After this unpleasant experience, Aridæus 
      became an entirely reformed character, of quite exemplary virtue. Such a 
      startling change could not pass unnoticed; but it was only to a few of his 
      greatest friends that he told what had happened to him during the "three 
      days." The story runs as follows: pg 18THE VISION.When his consciousness passed out of the body, he experienced from the 
      change the same sort of sensation that a sailor would who had been swept 
      overboard into deep water. Then, coming up a little, he seemed to breathe 
      in every part of him, and to see on every side at once, as though the 
      soul--the "single eye"--had been opened.Of objects with which he had been previously familiar, he saw none save 
      the stars; they were, however, of stupendous size and at enormous 
      distances from one another, and poured forth a marvellous radiance of 
      colour and sound, so that the soul riding smoothly in the light, as a ship 
      in calm weather, sailed easily and swiftly in every direction.Omitting most of the things he saw, he pg 19said that the souls of the dead, in passing from below upwards, formed 
      a flame-like bubble from which the air was excluded; then the bubble 
      quietly broke, and they came forth with men-like forms and well-knit 
      frames. They, however, differed in their movements; some leaped out with 
      wonderful lightness and darted straight up; but others kept turning round 
      together in a circle, like spindles, bobbing up and down, with a mixed and 
      confused motion, which recovered its balance only after a long time and 
      with great difficulty.As to the majority of them, he did not know who they were; he 
      recognized, however, two or three acquaintances, and tried to join them 
      and enter into conversation. They, however, neither heard him, nor were 
      they themselves. Demented and panic-stricken, avoiding every look and 
      touch, they first turned round and round by themselves; then, falling in 
      with many in the same condition, they huddled together, drifting about in 
      every direction confusedly, with no object in view, and pg 20uttering meaningless shouts, like war-cries, intermingled with wails 
      and screams of fear.Other souls, however, were to be seen above at the top of the envelope 
      [or surround] shining with joy, frequently approaching one another in 
      friendly intercourse but avoiding the troubled souls below them. They 
      seemed to show their dislike by drawing themselves together into 
      themselves, and their joy and delight by expansion and extension.In that region, he said, he saw only one soul of a relative, though he 
      was not quite sure about it, for his kinsman had died while he (Aridæus) 
      was still a boy. However, he came up to him and said: "Welcome, 
      Thespesius!" And on his replying in surprise that his name was not 
      Thespesius, but Aridæus, the other remarked:"It was Aridæus, but from henceforth it will be Thespesius [that 
      is, ‘Sent by the Gods’]; for indeed thou art not dead, pg 21but by the will of the Gods thou art come hither with thy reason about 
      thee, whilst thou hast left the rest of thy soul, as it were an anchor, in 
      the body. And this thou mayest now and hereafter prove to thyself by the 
      fact that the souls of the dead cast no shadow and never close their 
      eyelids."On hearing this, Thespesius set himself the more to use his rational 
      faculties, and taking a closer look he saw that he had a faint and shadowy 
      outline attached to him, while they [the dead] shone all round and were 
      transparent, though not all in the same way. For some were like the purest 
      full-moon light, emitting one smooth, continuous and even colour; while 
      others had patches across them or narrow strips. Others again were quite 
      mottled--extraordinary sights--dappled with livid spots, like adders; and 
      others had faint scratches.Then Thespesius’ kinsman (for there is nothing to prevent our calling 
      souls by pg 22persons’ names) pointed out everything telling him that Adrasteia, 
      daughter of Necessity and Zeus, had been set in highest heaven to 
      administer retribution for all offences; and no sinner was either great 
      enough or small enough to escape her by force or avoid her vigilance."There are three kinds of punishment he continued, "each appropriate to 
      one of the warders and executors [of Adrasteia]. For speedy Punishment 
      (Poin‘ ) deals with those who 
      are chastized at once, in the body and through their bodies, but in 
      somewhat mild fashion, since many offences are passed over as requiring 
      purification only. In the case of those, however, whose moral cure is a 
      more serious business, they are handed over by their conscience (lit. 
      daimÇ n) to Justice (Dik‘ 
      ) after their decease. And finally, in the case of those who are rejected 
      by Justice as altogether incurable, Fury, (Erinys) the third and most 
      implacable of Adrasteia’s ministers, pursues them as pg 23they wander and flee, some one way, some another, and pitifully and 
      cruelly undoes them all and thrusts them down into a state of which we can 
      neither speak nor think."Of these [three] kinds of correction," he said, "that which is 
      effected by Punishment, while a man is still alive, resembles a method of 
      chastisement in vogue with the Persians, among others, when they strip the 
      clothes and headresses off the culprits and scourge the former, while the 
      latter entreat them with tears to stop. In like manner, punishments by 
      means of loss of goods and bodily suffering do not really probe the 
      disease sharply nor reach vice itself, but for the most part touch only 
      the reputations and sensibilities of the culprits."Accordingly whenever a man leaves that world for this unpunished and 
      impure, Justice grips him by the soul just as he is, naked, unable to put 
      anything on, and so hide and cloak his villainy, pg 24but every bit of him in full view of every one on all sides."And first of all he is shown to his good parents, if such they are, or 
      to his ancestors, as an object of loathing and a disgrace to the family; 
      whereas if his forebears are bad, he has to look on their punishments and 
      they on his; and this continues for a long time, until he has exhausted 
      every one of his evil tendencies in pain and toil, which in extent and 
      intensity as much exceed all suffering in the body, as waking 
      consciousness is more vivid than a dream. And the scars and marks of every 
      one of their evil tendencies more or less remain on all of them."Observe," he continued, "the colours of the souls of every shade and 
      sort: that greasy brown-grey is the pigment of sordidness and selfishnes; 
      that blood-red inflamed shade is a sign of a savage and venomous nature; 
      wherever blue-gray is, from such a nature incontinence in pleasure is not 
      easily eradicated; innate malignity with envy, causes that pg 25livid discoloration in the same way as cuttle-fish eject their sepia."Now it is in earth-life that the vice of the soul (being acted upon by 
      the passions and reacting upon the body) produces these discolorations; 
      while the purification and correction here have for their object the 
      removal of these blemishes, so that the soul may become entirely ray-like 
      (augoeid‘ s) and of 
      uniform colour."As long as these colours are present, there are relapses into the 
      passions, accompanied with pulsings and throbbings; with some souls faint 
      and soon suppressed, but with others vigorously intensified."Of these, some by dint of repeated correction at length recover their 
      proper disposition and condition; others again, by the strength of their 
      intractability and their being nailed down to the love of pleasure, are 
      carried down to the bodies of beasts."The former, through weakness of reason and inertia of the 
      contemplative pg 26principle, are carried down by the practical element to birth [as men]; 
      while the latter, lacking an instrument for their unbridled lust, long to 
      unite desires to enjoyment and bring these together by means of [any] 
      body,--for out of body there is only an imperfect shadow and dream of 
      pleasure without fulfilment."After these explanations he was conducted by his guide at great speed 
      across an immense space, as it seemed, nevertheless easily and directly as 
      though supported by wings of light-rays, until, having arrived at a vast 
      vortex extending downwards, he was abandoned by the power which supported 
      him.He observed also that the same thing happened to the rest of the souls 
      there; for checking their flight, like birds, and sinking down, they 
      fluttered round the vortex in a circle, not daring to go straight through 
      it.Inside it seemed to be decked, like pg 27Bacchic Caves, with trees and verdure and every kind of foliage; while 
      out of it there breathed a soft and gentle air, laden with marvellous 
      sweet scents, making a blend like wine for topers, so that the souls 
      feasting on the perfume were melted with delight in mutual embraces, while 
      the whole place was wrapt in revelry and laughter and the spirit of sport 
      and pleasure.Thespesius’ guide told him that this was the way by which Dionysus 
      ascended to the Gods and afterwards took up Semel‘ 
      ; it was called the Place of Oblivion (L‘ 
      th‘ ).Therefore he would not suffer Thespesius to stay there, though he 
      wished to do so, but forcibly dragged him away; explaining how that the 
      rational element of the soul was melted and moistened by pleasure, while 
      the irrational and that which tends to body being thus moistened and made 
      fleshly, awakens the memory of the body, and from this memory comes a 
      yearning and desire which drag down the pg 28soul into generation, . . . the soul-being weighed down with moisture.Then Thespesius, after taking another journey as great as the former 
      one, seemed to see in the distance a huge basin, with streams flowing into 
      it: one whiter than the foam of the sea or snow; another like the purple 
      which the rainbow sends forth; while others were tinged with other 
      colours, each at a distance having its own splendour.But when they came closer, the basin itself (the surroundings 
      disappearing and the colours growing fainter) lost its varied colouring 
      and retained only a white brilliance. And he saw three beings (daimones) 
      seated together, forming a triangle one with the other, mixing the streams 
      in definite proportions.Thespesius’ soul-guide thereupon informed him that Orpheus had advanced 
      as far as this when he went in search of the soul of his wife, but, 
      through not remembering correctly, had spread an erroneous pg 29report that the Oracle at Delphi was shared by Apollo and Night, 
      whereas Apollo had nothing to do with Night."But that which you see," he said, "is the common oracle of Night and 
      Sel‘ n‘ 
      , which eventuates nowhere on the earth in one particular seat, but 
      meanders in every direction manwards in visions and images. It is from 
      this that dreams, after being mixed, as you see, spread abroad a mixture 
      of the simple and true with the complex and fallacious."As for the Oracle of Apollo," he continued, "you have not seen it, nor 
      will you be able to do so, for the stern-cable of your soul does not give 
      or slacken further upwards, but drags it down through being made fast to 
      the body."At the same time his guide brought him closer and tried to show him the 
      light which streamed from the Tripod, as he explained, through the Bosom 
      of Themis and rested upon Parnassus. pg 30But though he longed to see, he could not because of the dazzling 
      nature of the light. As he passed, however, he caught a woman’s high voice 
      in rhythmic verse prophesying--among other things apparently the time of 
      his own death.His genius (daimÇn) 
      told him that this was the voice of the Sibyl, who sings of things to come 
      as she circles in the face of the Moon. He would therefore have liked to 
      hear more, but was driven in the opposite direction by the Moon’s impetus, 
      as in the eddies of a whirlpool. So he heard but little, but that little 
      contained a prophecy about Mount Vesuvius and the destruction of 
      Dicæarcheia by fire, and a scrap about the reigning Emperor, which ran:"Being good, by sickness will he leave his throne."After this they turned back to see the punishments. And first of all 
      nothing but distressing and pitiful sights met their eyes; till suddenly 
      Thespesius, without pg 31at all expecting it, came across his own friends, kinsfolk and 
      intimates in torment; and they in their terrible sufferings and unseemly 
      and painful chastisements lamented and wept aloud to him.And last of all he looked down upon his own father emerging from some 
      sort of a pit, covered with marks and scars, stretching out his hands to 
      him; he was no longer allowed to keep silence, but compelled by the 
      authorities to confess that his hands were stained with the blood of some 
      wealthy strangers he had poisoned. On earth he had completely succeeding 
      in escaping detection, but in the after-state all was brought home to him; 
      for part of his crimes he had already been punished, but for the rest he 
      had still to suffer.But so great were Thespesius’ consternation and terror, that he dared 
      not intercede or entreat for his father. When, however, he would have 
      turned and fled, he could no longer see his gentle and familiar guide, but 
      was thrust forward by pg 32others of terrifying appearance, and as though there were no choice but 
      to go through with the business.Thus he had to see that the shades of those who were known to be bad 
      and had been punished in earth-life, did not get such a dressing, as they 
      had already done hard labour for their irrational and passionate natures; 
      whereas those who had passed their lives in undetected vice, under cloak 
      and show of virtue, were forced by those who surrounded them, to turn 
      their souls inside out in throes of pain, wriggling in unnatural 
      contortions, just as sea-polyps turn themselves inside out after 
      swallowing the hook.Some of these they flayed, and peeling off their skins showed them 
      covered with spots and festering sores, owing to the diseased condition of 
      their rational and ruling principle. Others, he said, he saw entwined like 
      snakes, two, three, or more together, malevolently pg 33devouring one another in revenge for what they had suffered or done to 
      each other while living.There were further [three] lakes alongside one another: one of 
      boiling-hot gold; one of lead, bitterly cold; another of iron, terribly 
      hard. And there were dæmons on duty, who, just like smiths with tongs, put 
      in and took out the souls of those who suffered from the vice of 
      insatiable greed and avarice.After they had been made red-hot and transparent by firing them in the 
      gold lake, they thrust them into the lead one and gave them a bath in it; 
      and after they had been frozen there and made as hard as hail, they 
      further transferred them into the lake of iron; there they became terribly 
      black, and after being smashed up by its hardness and crushed to atoms, 
      they changed their shapes. They were then in this state taken back to the 
      gold lake, suffering, he said, terrible agonies in their transformations. pg 34But the most pitiable sufferings of all, Thespesius declared, were 
      those of the souls who, when they seemed to have at last got their 
      discharge from Justice, were arrested again. These were the souls of those 
      whose crimes had been visited on their children or descendants.For whenever one of the latter happened to come up, he fell upon the 
      criminal in a rage, crying out against him and showing him the marks of 
      his sufferings, reproaching him and pursuing after him. And though he 
      tried to get away and hide himself, he could not; for the chastizers 
      speedily hunted them back to Justice and constrained them all over again, 
      in spite of their pitiful cries for mercy owing to what they already knew 
      of the punishments in store.And to some of them, he said, many of the souls of their descendants 
      attached themselves, just like bees or bats, crowding thick upon each 
      other, and gibbering in anger at the memory of what they had suffered 
      through them. pg 35Last of all he saw the souls [of this class] who were returning to 
      birth, being forcibly turned into all sorts of beasts, having their shapes 
      changed by the shapers of animals, with blows of curious instruments. In 
      some cases they hammered the whole of their parts together; in others they 
      twisted them back, and some parts they planed off smooth, and got rid of 
      them entirely, so that they might be fitted to other habits and modes of 
      life.Among them he saw the soul of Nero in a bad state generally and pierced 
      with red-hot nails. The smiths had in hand for it the form of Pindar’s 
      viper, in which it would be conceived and come to life by gnawing itself 
      through its mother.Hereupon, he said, a great light suddenly shone forth, and a voice from 
      the light was heard giving orders to change it into a milder type, and 
      devise a creature that croaks round marshes and lakes; he had been already 
      punished for his crimes, pg 36and now some favour was due to him from the Gods for having freed 
      Greece, the most excellent nation of his subjects and the one dearest to 
      the Gods.This was as far as Thespesius got in his vision. When, however, he was 
      going to turn back, he had a most terrible fright; for a woman of amazing 
      form and size seized hold of him, with the words: "Come thou to me so that 
      thou mayest the better remember the details"; and she was just going to 
      use on him a red-hot stylus, like [encaustic] painters, when another woman 
      stopped her.Then, as though he were suddenly sucked through a tube by a terribly 
      strong and violent in-breath, he lit in his body, and woke up just as they 
      were on the point of burying him. pg 37The consideration of this story of vision opens up so many important 
      questions that the main difficulty is to compress within the limits of 
      this small volume a portion of what might be written. I shall therefore 
      attempt to touch on some of the more general points of interest only.We first notice that the consciousness of the soul passes from what we 
      may call the plane of "earth" to that of "water"; and it is probably from 
      this, which seems to be a somewhat general fact of psychic experience, 
      that the glyphs of "water," "sea," "ocean," etc., have been adopted so 
      widely as symbolic of subtle matter.In this state souls may be said to "sail about," because apparently 
      there is no motion of limbs; their "astral" vehicle pg 38is conveyed by the current; they sail about on sound- or light-waves, 
      perceiving no ordinary physical mind-forms, but "stars," certain 
      magnitudes, or perhaps "nodes," where certain greater currents meet. Or, 
      if we must interpret this sublime spectacle in a more physical sense, it 
      may be said to pertain to the region beyond the lower earth-atmosphere 
      where sight is unobscured by that atmosphere. The "single eye" is a Platonic term. The "flame-like bubble" vehicling the souls of the dead is a graphic 
      phrase that reminds us admirably of all we have heard of what has been 
      called in modern theosophy the "auric envelope."But why is the "air" said to be excluded from it? If it is permissible 
      to lay stress on the point, I would suggest that it is because what is 
      called here "air," in connection with what has been previously called 
      "earth" and "water," pg 39is that which brings with it proper self-consciousness. "Fire," 
      "water," and "earth" play together to make the "forms." If the "bubbles" 
      had had "air" in them, they would have been fully developed proper souls, 
      capable of looking at themselves, considering and studying themselves from 
      without personality. The "bubbles" thus pertain to a lower state of 
      development, namely, the "watery spheres."But I fear that this mode of interpretation may perhaps prove slightly 
      perplexing, and I will therefore not pursue it. It need only be added, to 
      complete the idea for those who choose to follow it up for themselves, 
      that it might be said that every one at death delivers over something, and 
      then reappears in his own true inner form. Those who "darted straight up" 
      to the higher "air," would thus be those who were able to retain with 
      themselves something outside personality."Air," in this sense would be outside pg 40personality, and we need something within ourselves to correspond, to 
      attract us "up" to these more transcendent states of consciousness.To keep more closely to our text; the vision here seems to describe in 
      graphic fashion the difference between souls that are balanced and souls 
      that are unbalanced; the former pass to a state of calm, if not of 
      equilibrium, and the latter remain in the swirling currents of the lower 
      emotional nature, the currents or streams in the great emotional sea, on 
      the waves of which they drift rather than sail. Its state is determined by 
      whether the soul’s consciousness is centered in a properly built formal or 
      completely human mind or in an embryonic or animal-human mind. In Greek 
      terms, these states or habitats are called Elysium and Hades; or, if we 
      please, the higher and lower Hades or Invisible.The state of the less developed souls is well depicted by our vision, 
      for numerous pg 41seers in our own day agree in stating that many of those who die are 
      either in great fear owing to the soul-paralyzing doctrine of an eternal 
      hell, or are all-distraught at the strange and unexpected nature of their 
      surroundings, being aware of neither where they are nor what is expected 
      of them.Our seer tried to talk to them, but they avoided him. This is 
      apparently more or less true at all times and in all places under such 
      circumstances; for Aridæus being still alive, and being under special 
      favour, or "the will of the Gods," had his consciousness out-turned, 
      whilst theirs was in-turned. And in general it may be said that people who 
      are selfish and live centered on themselves, will never pay attention when 
      higher intelligencies speak to them. Fear is another characteristic of 
      souls in this state; they always think external forces are going to injure 
      them. This is presumably because it stops their pg 42own self-meditation, which is their only idea of happiness.The envelope or surround that contained Elysium and Hades was thought 
      of by the ancients as extending "as far as the moon"; for they generally 
      thought of the after-death state from a purely objective physical 
      standpoint. The "moon" was thus the physical moon, and the sublunary 
      regions were the earth’s atmosphere as far as the moon. Mystically the 
      sublunary are the states "ruled by the Moon," the Mystic Mother who weaves 
      the silver ghosts that dance round all, up to a certain stage in 
      evolution, when the Sun of the true mind shines forth with golden rays.With regard to souls in the higher portions of the surround, the 
      Elysian state proper or higher heaven-world, the unselfish 
      outward-looking characteristic of mind always brings joy, radiant joy, 
      which in its fairest modes may well be thought to go forth so as to 
      benefit all pg 43the world. There should always be a large capacity for such joy in any 
      soul that is really and truly thus turned outward and is growing fast. 
      Such souls expand to show joy; this expansion connotes at the same time, 
      adhering and clinging to the beloved object. The two expand till they 
      embrace and interpenetrate; for love interpenetrates.The change of name from Aridæus to Thespesius is to be noted. Change of 
      name is found in almost all initiatory rites, and corresponds to an inner 
      change of power. In the mystery-language of the Greeks, the epopt may be 
      said to meet with the psychopomp; the soul meets with a more ancient 
      kinsman belonging to the family of its higher self.The soul of Aridæus was still attached to the body by a link, which 
      when translated into terms of physical vision appeared as a cord. This has 
      been very frequently seen by seers; it corresponds pg 44with the umbilical cord of the child. There is apparently a 
      corresponding connection between any two vehicles of man’s consciousness; 
      but whereas on the physical plane it is a cord, on other planes it would 
      be better, perhaps, to think of it as a super-physical (magnetic, psychic, 
      mental, etc.) connection.Aridæus is next told to notice that the souls of the dead never close 
      their eyelids. And it has been remarked by many that "ghosts" and 
      apparitions of the dead never do so. The natural closing of the eyes is 
      normally conditioned in our world by alternations of light and darkness, 
      depending on the revolution of the earth; but in the subtle state of 
      matter, where the solid earth does not intervene to shut out the sunlight, 
      the realm of the "astral light," there are no alternations of light and 
      darkness.It is said that the Gods never close their eyes, and there is also an 
      apocryphal legend that tells us the same of Jesus. pg 45The "shadow," again, which Aridæus throws owing to his still being 
      alive and not one of the dead, is presumably some portion of subtle 
      physical matter which clouds his psychic envelope, in that he was still 
      "anchored" to his body, by means of what we may call a psycho-physical 
      magnetic current.Mystically it may be said that while the physical external sun casts a 
      shadow, when we are our own Sun, we do not cast a shadow.Again mystically it may be said that it is the mind in man which casts 
      shadow and gives position relative to the inward Sun.The "dead," again in this connection, may also mean those who have 
      retired right out of the physical and mental form and are struggling in 
      either the lower or higher soul-state.It is said that there are states of subtle matter analogous to the 
      solid, liquid and gaseous states of the physical, synthesized pg 46by a fourth, the etheric; or again, the earthy, watery, airy, fiery 
      states, synthesized by the fifth, or quintessence, according to the 
      immemorial scheme of the four elements; or again of seven, perhaps by a 
      duplication of the first category.After death, it is said, the soul, or rather the psychic envelope, 
      passed through corresponding stages, gradually shedding off the denser 
      phases and becoming more and more ethereal. This subtle matter and all of 
      its phases are luminiferous, and with this in mind it is easy to follow 
      the idea of the light-colours playing over and through the soul-envelope, 
      and to understand how they are of different radiance according to the 
      phase of substance which is dominant in this subtle envelope.The majority of humans, it is said, spend most of their after-death 
      existence in such conditions. But it would seem that the intermediary 
      state and the heaven-state are conditioned by modes of motion rather than 
      by form. I can well believe pg 47that we do not die in order to live in another kind of a prison-house 
      of a subtle body of form, but rather that we die to experience the exact 
      opposite of what we experience on earth, to be turned as it were "inside 
      out," to revivify ourselves, to live in a state where form is ever 
      interchangeable and power or life is the law or rule or guiding principle.Most people, if we can believe our text is based upon a foundation of 
      true vision, are carried about on the psychic streams; those who have 
      built themselves a formal mind preserve their balance, and sail about in 
      the sea very happily; those whose mentality is only slightly developed and 
      have no right tendencies, wobble about, so to speak, and get somewhat 
      giddy, we may suppose.More advanced souls who have built themselves what is called a 
      "formless" mind, enter the spiritual state. We cannot, I believe, get 
      there without a "formless" mind, for we must have some pg 48mind there for experience; for it is by mind that the psychic is 
      changed to the spiritual state. It is mind in its widest sense that 
      mystically alters for the individual the direction of the ceaseless 
      ever-flowing psychic into the self-centralization and all-directions of 
      the spiritual. Perhaps some may object to this use of the term "psychic" 
      and "spiritual," but I am using them here in their Gnostic meanings.The term "formless mind" is obscure. It represents the Sanskrit arã 
      pa, and I here mean by it the power of mind deduced from its forms.This mind would spiritually cast no "shadow"; it would give its 
      possessor the capacity of seeing round himself, so to say, observing that 
      which was other than himself, for the fundamental principle of mind is to 
      observe that which is not oneself.Those among the "dead" who possess it, it is easy to believe, can 
      converse and learn and come back (according to the pg 49doctrine of re-incarnation) far wiser than those who spend their time 
      encased in selfishness and unable to respond to "external" contacts, 
      except those that happen exactly to match their own, when of course they 
      can hardly be said to be "external." If they are in unison there is not 
      much to be learned.We have next an exposition of the K~ 
      rmic Powers at work in the world.First, there is the Unmanifest; then the Manifested or Creative Logos, 
      Zeus, in his mode of self-limitation, that is to say, with his 
      counterpart, spouse, power, or syzygy, Necessity.The daughter of Zeus and Necessity is Adrasteia, the Inevitable 
      (She-from-whom-none-can-escape, literally), the K~ 
      rmic Law.Servants to her are the three great Powers, Punishment (or 
      Retribution), Justice and Fury (or Vengeance).Thus there are seven great K~ 
      rmic Powers in all. This may be said to be the pg 50hierarchy of the justice-side of the Logos; the hierarchy of the 
      mercy-side is another, and yet, perchance, the same.Punishment has Earth assigned to her as her field of operation; to 
      Justice is assigned the realm of Hades. Mystically this Justice may be 
      well thought of as the pure light of conscience, so beautifully named the 
      Virgin of Light, the Judge, in Magian, Gnostic and Manichæan tradition. 
      The Virgin of Light is, I believe, that pure state which gives birth to 
      really unbiassed understanding. It may be said to be man’s higher 
      unbiassed impersonal mind shining into his lower mind. The idea of 
      Justice, Purity and Virginity are here all intimately connected.Vengeance, the third of Adrasteia’s ministers, thrusts the incorrigible 
      down "into a state of which we can neither speak nor think," says our 
      seer’s guide; for such speech or thought, presumably, would bring its 
      pictures up before the sight of the "single eye." This is evidently the 
      state which the Greeks pg 51called Tartarus (Tar-Tar), doubtless a loan-word from some 
      other, and perhaps more ancient, tongue; a "double" possessed of a mystic 
      root-meaning for those skilled in the most primitive of all languages, 
      which the Greeks called onomatopoi‘ 
      sis. It corresponds, though very imperfectly, with the Av§ 
      chi of the Brahmans and Buddhists. The word a-v§ 
      chi is said to mean "wave-less." In its extreme sense it is the final 
      state into which the irredeemably evil in spiritual wickedness are thrust, 
      until the end of a world-period. It is called waveless, presumably, 
      because it is a state of complete isolation, and is referred to frequently 
      in the Pistis Sophia, a Christian Gnostic document with an Egyptian 
      background.The torments of this Tartarus are set forth graphically later on in our 
      text. With regard to the corrections in Hades, or the Invisible, I would 
      suggest that the inner side of the matter (whatever the outward appearance 
      may be to the seer) is that we live over again all our evil and pg 52good deeds, but now with knowledge and understanding.Realization makes us understand the justice of punishment and reward. 
      We go through the whole thing ourselves, working it out in immediate 
      experience. The light of our own higher consciousness casts our 
      imperfections into deeper shadow. Our thoughts and emotions become 
      objective to us, and the problems are worked out in very convincing 
      dramatic incidents of a most intimate nature, supplied by the 
      kaleidoscopic memory of the pictures of past deeds.We are stripped naked to ourselves, and hence, to the world of our 
      consciousness we can no longer deceive. This stripping naked is an 
      indispensable condition of progress, and this is why we must be utterly 
      honest with ourselves. We thus may be said in "trampling on the garment of 
      shame" to lose all shame. "Naked we go to the Naked"--that is, to the 
      Pure. pg 53It is next to be remembered that in all folk-conceptions of after-death 
      states, and the relation of the living to the dead, the blood-bond is 
      the bond. This is, I think, at the bottom of all ancestor-worship. It 
      is the idea of the group-soul, tribe and family. The root-contract is 
      along the line of blood; that is, the kinship of the animal-human soul. 
      Aridæus thus naturally meets with his "ancestors."The scheme of the "colours of the souls" most probably pertained to the 
      mystery-doctrine or esoteric teaching which was at that date so widely in 
      the Hellenistic world. Thus, referring to Jacob’s dream of the white, and 
      spotted, and ring-straked and speckled kine, Philo of Alexandria tells us 
      that this must be taken as an allegory of souls. The first class of souls, 
      he says, is "white.""The meaning is that when the soul receives the Divine Seed [of the 
      Logos], the first-born births are spotlessly white, pg 54like unto the light of utmost purity, to radiance of the greatest 
      brilliance, as though it were the shadowless ray of the sun’s beams from 
      the cloudless sky at noon." (De Som., i. 35.)I might also suggest an analogy from the markings of bird’s eggs; the 
      thought-birds that issue from such soul-eggs being of different classes.I need hardly add for most of my readers, that the colours of the souls 
      and their meanings given in our text agree very closely with the scheme of 
      colours published in a number of modern theosophical works.In connection with these colours and the purification of souls, 
      Plutarch gives us an interesting piece of information concerning the 
      philosophy and psychology of the doctrine of metempsychosis as held in his 
      day, when he writes:"The former souls through weakness of reason, and inertia of the 
      contemplative pg 55principle are carried down by the practical element to birth as men; 
      while the latter, lacking an instrument for their unbridled lust, long to 
      unite desires to enjoyment and bring them together by means of any 
      body,--for out of body there is for such souls only an imperfect shadow 
      and dream of pleasure, without fulfilment."The contemplative and practical elements of the soul may be usefully 
      compared with the qualities or modes (guna’s) of nature which the 
      Indian philosophers characterize respectively as "pure" (s~ 
      ttvika--the symbolical colour of which is "white"), and "passionate" (r~ 
      jasa--colour "red")--though indeed it is very difficult to find 
      English equivalents for the root-meanings of these Sanskrit terms.According to Proclus the contemplative (or theoretic) and the practical 
      are the higher and lower tendencies of the rational principle (logos). pg 56The term "theoretic" has nothing to do with the modern meaning of the 
      word, but is derived from theoría, which signifies direct sight or 
      eye-to-eye knowledge--gnosis.Macrobius tells us further that the former is "ruled by Saturn" and the 
      latter by "Jupiter." According to the mythology, or rather theology, of 
      the Greeks, Kronos (Saturn) was father of Zeus (Jupiter). Zeus may here be 
      said to be the fabricative power of the Logos.Porphyry, in his Introduction to the philosophy of Plotinus, tells us 
      that the contemplative or theoretic life has three grades of virtues, the 
      highest of which is the ideal or paradigmatic, pertaining to the spiritual 
      (formless) mind alone. These are the Uranic powers latent in man; Uranus 
      being father of Kronos. They transcend the rest of the soul-powers, just 
      as the type or paradigm transcends the image; for the spiritual mind 
      contacts at once and the same time all the essences pg 57which are the types of lower things.The most intractable class of souls are centred in the animal nature; 
      they are dominated by that mode (guna), which the Indian 
      philosophers call "dark" (t~ 
      masa--colour "black"), and the description of their most 
      characteristic tendency is corroborated by many seers to-day.When this mode is in the ascendant, then, and only then, it is said, is 
      retrogression into the "nature of an animal" possible; such a soul allies 
      itself with the irrational. The theory of "re-incarnation into animals" is 
      treated at some length in my volumes on Thrice-greatest Hermes, and it is 
      only necessary here, in order to safeguard the philosophical view of the 
      matter, to quote from Proclus:"But the true reason asserts that though the human soul may be degraded 
      to brutes, it is only to brutes that possess the life suited to such 
      purpose, while the degraded soul is as it were vehicled in pg 58this life [not body], and bound to it sympathetically."Our story next introduces us to a change of scene, a vision of the 
      Descent into Genesis, the Vortex that carries the souls down to physical 
      birth.What the meaning of the Bacchic Caves may be I am not able precisely to 
      say. One commentator tells us that there were in Naxos, and on Parnassus, 
      and elsewhere, caves dedicated to Bacchus, "i.e., to mirth and 
      jollity"; and that "the mouths of these caves were of course decked with 
      all of verdure and bloom that could make them charming and attractive." 
      This may be so; but I am more inclined to think that Plutarch, who was an 
      initiated Dionysian, is comparing the vision with the scenic setting of 
      the mystery-rites.However this may be, others have described something very similar 
      concerning this mystery and that of the Basin later on, as the following 
      picture of what pg 59the writer calls "The Mart of the Souls" (see Theosoph. Rev., 
      Mar., 1905) may testify."He looked down, and behold a whirlpool swirled and swept unceasingly 
      before him, the brim of which was stained as though with dyes. Above his 
      head hung a mighty upturned chalice, from whose lip drained a measure as 
      of honey; and it seemed to the man that drop by drop fell into the swirl 
      of the pool, and laid itself along the brim. . . ."The man saw the thin pale flame-shapes gather round the margin of the 
      pool. Behind them crept strange mists and pallid shadows, shapeless, yet 
      holding potential forms; forms of ripples, of waves, of the strange clouds 
      that lie about the sky at sunset, of all things unearthly, yet which mimic 
      earth. And the shapeless shadows, too, crept down to the lip of the pool. 
      As they reached the edge where the dyed waters leapt, flame and shadow 
      fused and melted into one, and pg 60stood a moment fully formed upon the brink. And the man saw through and 
      through each soul as it stood in its winding sheet of mist. Behind, beyond 
      and through the colours of the vesture, running from the honeyed chalice 
      and the dyed waves, up through the shadows round the separate white 
      flames, the man saw past and future linked in the present; the individual 
      life manifest from that which is called its beginning to that which men 
      call the end. So that to him for the moment, as to each soul, all hearts 
      were opened, and from him no secrets were hid. And he saw this knowledge 
      burning in the flame of each."Then the shadow-flames circled round the pool as though in a mystic 
      dance, and the sound of them as they drifted by was as the music of a 
      spell. Deeper hues swept from the brim of the pool to the edges of the 
      shadows, and thicker and ever thicker fell the drops of honey from the 
      chalice over them. The shadows took shape and colour before the man, pg 61standing for a moment men like himself, and yet unlike. For they stood 
      as men may stand on Judgment Day, victim and priest, judge and sinner, one 
      and the same, each himself, yet each but part of the rest, judging the 
      earth in himself, and himself in the earth. Then the colours thickened, 
      each hue losing its poignant individuality, merging each in each. And as 
      the colours blurred, so grew the forms more dense. And as the density 
      increased, so did each shadow--erstwhile vast--diminish, drawing to its 
      centre, till it seemed to the man that he looked but on a swarm of bees 
      circling round the rims of one gigantic honey pool. The dyed brim seemed 
      to throw out flowers, great petalled blossoms of amber and orange and 
      scarlet and sapphire, reaching from edge to edge of the whirling water. 
      There was the taste and taint of honey in the air."But to return to the text of our vision; if this mystery be the "way 
      down," pg 62equally is it the "way up." It was "the way by which Dionysus ascended 
      to the Gods." Here again, I think, Plutarch refers to a mystery-myth into 
      which he was initiated. Generally, it may be said to refer to the "greater 
      mysteries"--those of "regeneration," the "way up," while the "lesser 
      mysteries," those of "generation," pertain to the "way down."The young Bacchus, the Iacchos of the Mysteries, after his own ascent, 
      took up his mother to the Gods--the assumption. Semel‘ 
      , in giving birth to Bacchus, the son of Zeus (the creative power of the 
      Logos), is said to have been killed, and subsequently restored by her son 
      to life among the Gods, under a changed name. Mystically, the soul is said 
      to "die" in giving birth to itself on this plane. The "child" thus born 
      may in its turn, in the case of one truly regenerate, become the saviour 
      of its "mother," and raise her from the "dead" to spiritual life among the 
      immortals. pg 63In Christian Gnostic tradition this was shown forth at great length in 
      the Sophia-mythus or Wisdom-myth. The Christ rescues and raises the fallen 
      and dead Sophia or soul.Speaking of this Vortex, which is also called Crat‘ 
      r (Mixing-bowl) or Basin, Macrobius writes:"Plato speaks of this in the Phædo and says that the soul is 
      dragged back into body, hurried down by a new intoxication, desiring to 
      taste a fresh draught of the overflow of matter; whereby it is weighed 
      down and brought back to earth. The astral Crater of Dionysus is a symbol 
      of this mystery; and this is what the ancients called the River of L‘ 
      th‘ ."I have treated of these matters at length in the volumes already 
      referred to. It is necessary, however, to remind ourselves that all these 
      mystery-terms may be taken in a number of senses. I have here attempted to 
      suggest only the pg 64meaning which seems most suited to the text. The River of L‘ 
      th‘ , or Place of Oblivion, 
      separates all states and planes from one another. Happy he who can 
      remember and cross it safely whenever and wherever it meets him.The scene again changes, and the vision is that of the "way up" of the 
      seer, the same mystery as before, but from another point of view. For if 
      there is a Plain of Forgetfulness, there is also a Plain of Truth, of 
      which the scene in our vision is a reflection. For Plutarch elsewhere, 
      speaking of the Great Triangle of the Universe, writes:"The Area of the Triangle is the Common Hearth of all, and is called 
      the Plain of Truth, in which the logoi and ideas and paradigms of 
      all things which have been, and which shall be, lie immutable; and the Æon 
      (or Eternity) being round them, Time flows down upon the world like a 
      stream. And the sight and pg 65contemplation of these things are possible for the souls of men only 
      once in 10,000 years, should they have lived a virtuous life."That is to say, I believe, following the tradition of the Pythagoreans, 
      10 x 10 x 10 x 10,--the completion or perfection (10) of all the 
      possibilities of the Square (4) of matter, as contrasted with the Triangle 
      (3) of spirit.Plutarch continues (in this I think speaking of what he knew or had 
      been taught):"And the highest of our initiations here below is only the dream of 
      that true vision and initiation; and the discourses [sci., 
      delivered in the mysteries] have been carefully devised to awaken the 
      memory of the sublime things above, or else are to no purpose."But to return to our text and the lunar reflection of this eternal 
      Sun-land; the pg 66statement that Orpheus had advanced "as far as this" only, must, I 
      think, be taken as an indication of jalousie de métier. Plutarch 
      was high priest of Apollo at Delphi and had doubtless a bone of contention 
      to pick either with his Orphic contemporaries or with the Orphic 
      tradition, which had perhaps belittled the Delphic Oracle.However this may be, this Crater is declared to be the Oracle of Sel‘ 
      n‘ , the Moon. That is to say, 
      it pertained to all sublunary dreams and visions--"a mixture of the simple 
      and true with the complex and fallacious."Beyond this Aridæus could not see, for thereafter began the true 
      Light-world, glimpses of which are so marvellously pourtrayed in Gnostic 
      tradition. Aridæus was still bound to the body, and had not yet been made 
      pure, or freed himself from the "world-illusion," as the Hermes-mystics 
      called it.The Light of the Spiritual Sun streamed from the Supernal Tripod, or 
      Triangle, of pg 67the Plain of Truth, through the Bosom of Themis.Themis is fabled to have been the daughter of Uranus and G‘ 
      , of Heaven and Earth, the primæval cosmic pair, or syzygy. Themis is 
      Order, Truth, Equity. The tradition of the Delphians was that their Oracle 
      was first possessed by G‘ , 
      then by Themis (whom antiquity regarded as a very ancient prophetic 
      divinity), and finally by Apollo. Parnassus was their Holy Mount. The 
      whole symbolism, therefore, agrees with many another mystic tradition, in 
      which the Mount of Contemplation must be ascended before the Sunrise can 
      be seen.But this was not for Aridæus as yet; he could not see, he could only 
      hear--the voice of the Sibyl. Legend supposed that the so-called face of 
      the moon was that of the Sibyl gazing down upon the earth and singing its 
      fate and that of its dwellers as she circled round.The "prophecies" we must, I suppose, pg 68take as we take those of the Jewish Sibyllines; that is, as after the 
      event. The famous eruption of Vesuvius took place in 79 
      A.D., and this event is said to have been foretold in the Roman 
      Sibylline Books. Dicæarcheia was one of the towns destroyed, afterwards 
      called Puteoli, the modern Puzzuoli.As Vespasian died of disease and was not assassinated, as were so many 
      of the Emperors, also in 79 A.D., we may perhaps 
      have here an indication of a date terminus of our story, or of the writing 
      of the treatise of Plutarch, if that is of any importance.The scene next changes to a gruesome vision of the inferno, where it is 
      to be noted that his terror deprived the seer of the presence of his 
      "gentle and familiar guide," and immersed him in all the horrors of the 
      infernal living picture-gallery.The idea of being turned "inside-out" pg 69in the after-state is graphically compared with the sea-polyps or 
      scolopendra, a fish that was supposed by the ancients to have the power 
      occasionally of throwing out its intestines. When caught by a hook it was 
      fabled to eject its entrails, remove the hook and then take them in 
      again--an excellent "Philologic" romance, that does not, however, seem to 
      have come down to the mediæval Bestiaries.When used of the soul it suggests that the "inner" became as the 
      "outer," and the "outer" as the "inner." That is to say, in earth-life the 
      modes of passion are ever changing, while the external form remains the 
      same; whereas in this state of soul-life, the ruling modes of passion are 
      more constant and the external forms are ever changing. In other words, 
      the passions may be said to objectivize themselves, in that they 
      immediately work out or clothe themselves in appropriate forms.We next come to the "lakes" of the pg 70inferno, there being three of them, the root-number of the tradition in 
      which our vision has its setting. The "lakes" and the alchemical processes 
      suggest that the background of the whole picture had its original in 
      Egypt.The scene appears to depict symbolically the preparation of degenerate 
      souls prior to their being vehicled in the "life of an animal." From the 
      standpoint of mystic psychology this concerns the "configuration" of the 
      passional nature, or that nature which man shares with the animal, and may 
      be said to be connected with types of mind that may be classified by 
      parallels drawn from the types of animals, the lords of which are the 
      "sacred animals."The allusion to Nero is, of course, topical and again affords an 
      indication of date.What "Pindar’s viper," or a "Pindaric viper" may mean is hard to say. 
      It is most natural to suppose that we have here pg 71reference to some famous comparison of the great poet’s, and that the 
      ode which contained it is now lost.It refers, of course, to Nero’s guilt of matricide; while the "creature 
      that croaks" is a humorous allusion to the Emperor’s vanity and his 
      appearing in the theatre as a singer. It is, however, not true that Nero 
      freed Greece; he freed the province of Achæia only from taxes.Who the "woman of amazing form and size" may be, I cannot divine, 
      unless she be Memory, the counterpart of the Scribe of the Gods. Encaustic 
      painters, as they were called, burnt in the colours with a heated rod or 
      stylus.Aridæus returned to his body by way of a "vortex," even as he went 
      forth in the manner of a "bubble."In conclusion I would suggest that the story of the experiences of 
      Aridæus is either a literary subterfuge for describing pg 72part of the instruction in certain mysteries, or the vision, in popular 
      story-form, was considered so true a description of what was thought to be 
      the nature of the invisible world and the after-death conditions of the 
      soul, that it required little alteration to make it useful for that 
      purpose.It is further interesting to notice that one of the characters in 
      Plato’s Vision of Er is called Ardiæus, while in Plutarch the main 
      personage is called Aridæus. The transposition of a single letter is so 
      slight as to make the names practically identical, and the subject matter 
      is so similar that one is inclined to think there must be some connection 
      between these two famous visions. Moreover Aridæus is said to have been a 
      native of Soli in Cilicia, just as Er is said to have been a Pamphylian; 
      the tradition of both stories would then seem to have been derived from 
      Asia Minor, and the origin of them may be hidden in the syncretism of that 
      land--where West and East were for ever meeting. pg 73Our story would thus seem to be intended to give the reader an idea of 
      the impression made on the mind of one whom Plutarch would have us 
      consider one of the uninitiated, by the Vision of Hades, or of the 
      Invisible World, "as far as the moon." Sopat‘ 
      r of Apamea also tells us the story of a young man who had seen the 
      mysteries in a dream and had to be initiated afterwards.We are told that Aridæus returned to his body before undergoing some 
      process whereby he might "the better remember the details." What he 
      remembered, therefore, is confused, clothed in the language and symbols of 
      the mythologic recitals with which he was acquainted. Had Aridæus been 
      really initiated, he would probably not have been represented as requiring 
      a guide, and would have remembered everything clearly without the cloaking 
      of images reflected from physical forms, and of scenery created by the 
      recitals of popular religion, or the dramatic setting of formal 
      mystery-rites. [End]pg 74
