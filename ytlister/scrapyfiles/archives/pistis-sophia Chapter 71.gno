 Pistis Sophia
translated by G. S. R. MeadIt came to pass then, when the First Mystery had finished saying these words, that Matthew came forward and said: "I have understood the solution of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered. Now, therefore, give commandment unto me, that I speak it in openness."And the First Mystery answered and said: "I give commandment unto thee, Matthew, top. 131set forth the interpretation of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered."And Matthew answered and said: "Concerning the interpretation of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, thus thy light-power prophesied aforetime thereon through the Ode of Solomon:Matthew interpreteth the song of Sophia from the Odes of Solomon."'1. He who hath led me down out of the higher regions which are above, hath led me up out of |156. the regions which are in the bottom below."'2. Who hath there taken those in the midst, he hath taught me concerning them."'3. Who hath scattered my foes and my adversaries, he hath bestowed power on me over the bonds, to unloose them."'4. Who hath smitten the serpent with the seven heads with my hands, he hath set me up above its root, that I may extinguish its seed."'5. And thou wert with me, helping me; in all regions thy name surrounded me."'6. Thy right hand hath destroyed the venom of the slanderer; thy hand hath cleared the way for thy faithful."'7. Thou hast freed them out of the tombs and hast removed them from the midst of the corpses."'8. Thou hast taken dead bones and hast clothed them with a body and to them who stirred not, hast thou given the activity of life."'9. Thy way is become indestructibleness and thy face [also]."'10. Thou hast led thy æon above decay, so that they all may be loosed and renewed and thy light become a foundation for them all."'11. Thou hast piled thy riches upon them and they have become a holy dwelling-place.'p. 132"This then, my Lord, is the solution of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered. Hearken, therefore, that I may say it in openness."The word which thy power hath spoken through Solomon: 'Who hath led me down out of the higher regions which are above, he hath also led me up out of the regions which are in the bottom below,'--it is the |157. word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'I sing praises unto thee; through thy commandment hast thou led me down out of this higher æon which is above, and hast led me to the regions below. And again through thy commandment thou hast saved me and led me up out of the regions which are below.'"And the word which thy power hath spoken through Solomon: 'Who hath there taken those in the midst and hath taught me concerning them,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophis hath spoken: 'And again through thy commandment hast thou caused the matter in the midst of my power to be purified, and I have seen it.'"And moreover the word which thy power hath spoken through Solomon: 'Who hath scattered my foes and my adversaries,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'Thou hast scattered far from me all the emanations of Self-willed which constrained me and were hostile to me.'"And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'Who hath bestowed on me wisdom over the bonds, to unloose them,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'And he hath bestowed on me wisdom to loose myself from the bonds of those emanations.'"And the word which thy power hath spoken: Who hath smitten |158. the serpent with the sevenp. 133heads with my hands, he hath set me up above its root, that I may extinguish its seed,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'And thou hast smitten the serpent with the seven heads through my hands and set me up above its matter. Thou hast destroyed it, so that its seed may not raise itself up from now on.'"And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'And thou wert with me, helping me,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'And thou wert with me, giving me power in all this.'"And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'And thy name surrounded me in all regions,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'And thy light surrounded me in all their regions.'"And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'And thy right hand hath destroyed the venom of the slanderers,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'And through thee the emanations of Self-willed became powerless, for thou hast taken from them the light of their power.'"And the word which thy power hath spoken:Thy hand hath cleared the way for thy faithful,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'Thou hast made straight my way to lead me out of the chaos, because I have had faith in thee.'"And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'Thou hast freed them out of the tombs and hast removed them from the midst of the corpses,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'Thou hast freed me out of the chaos and removed me out of the material darknesses, that is |159. out of the dark emanations which are in the chaos, from which thou hast taken their light.'p. 134"And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'Thou hast taken dead bones and hast clothed them with a body, and to them who stirred not, thou hast given activity of life,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'And thou hast taken all my powers in which was no light, and hast bestowed on them within purified light, and unto all my limbs, in which no light stirred, thou hast given life-light out of thy Height.'"And the word which thy power hath spoken:Thy way is become indestructibleness, and thy face [also],'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'And thou hast made straight thy way for me, and the light of thy face hath become for me life indestructible.'"And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'Thou hast led thy æon above decay, so that all might be loosed and renewed,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'Thou hast led me, thy power, up above the chaos and above decay, that all the matters in that region may be loosed and all my powers renewed in the Light.'"And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'And thy light hath [become] foundation for them all,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'And thy light hath been in them all.' |160."And the word which thy light-power hath spoken through Solomon: 'Thou hast put thy riches over him, and he hath become a holy dwelling-place,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'Thou hast stayed the light of thy stream over me, and I have become a purified light.'"This then, my Lord, is the solution of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered."Return to the Gnostic Society Library
