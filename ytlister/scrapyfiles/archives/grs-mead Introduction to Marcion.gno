  Faith Forgotten (London and Benares, 1900; 3rd Edition 1931), pp.241- 249. MARCION was a rich shipowner of Sinope, the chief port of Pontus, on the southern shore
  of the Black Sea; he was also a bishop and the son of a bishop. His chief activity at Rome
  may be placed somewhere between the years 150 and 160. At first he was in communion with
  the church at Rome, and contributed handsomely to its funds; as, however, the presbyters
  could not explain his difficulties and refused to face the important questions he set
  before them, he is said to have threatened to make a schism in the church; and apparently
  was finally excommunicated. But as a matter of fact the origin of Marcionism is entirely wrapped in obscurity, and
  we know nothing of a reliable nature of the lives of either Cerdo or Marcion. The Church
  writers at the end of the second century, who are our best authorities, cannot tell the
  story of the beginning of the movement with any certainty. For all we know, Marcion may
  have developed his theories long before he came to Rome, and may have based them on
  information he gleaned and opinions he heard on his long voyages. This much we know, that the views of Marcion spread rapidly over the "whole
  world," to use the usual Patristic phrase for the Graeco- Roman dominions; and as
  late as the fifth century we hear of Theodoret converting more than a thousand
  Marcionites. In Italy, Egypt, Palestine, Arabia, Syria, Asia Minor and Persia, Marcionite
  churches sprang up, splendidly organised, with their own bishops and the rest of the
  ecclesiastical discipline, with a cult and service of the same nature as those of what
  subsequently became the Catholic Church. Orthodoxy had not declared for any party as yet,
  and the Marcionite view had then as good a chance as any other of becoming the universal
  one. What then was the secret of Marcion's success? As already pointed out, it was the
  same as that of the success of modern criticism as applied to the problem of the Old
  Testament. Marcion's view was in some respects even more moderate than the judgment of some of our
  modern thinkers; he was willing to admit that the Yahweh of the Old Testament was just.
  With great acumen he arranged the sayings and doings ascribed to Yahweh by the writers,
  and compilers, and editors of the heterogeneous books of the Old Testament collection, in
  parallel columns, so to say, with the sayings and teachings of the Christ-in a series of
  antitheses which brought out in startling fashion the fact, that though the best of the
  former might be ascribed to the idea of a Just God, they were foreign to the ideal of the
  Good God preached by the Christ. We know how in these latter days the best minds in the
  Church have rejected the horrible sayings and doings ascribed to God in some of the Old
  Testament documents, and we thus see how Marcion formulated a protest which must have
  already declared itself in the hearts of thousands of the more enlightened of the
  Christian name. As for the New Testament, in Marcion's time, the idea of a canon was not yet or was
  only just being thought of. Marcion, too, had an idea of a canon, but it was the antipodes
  of the views which afterwards became the basis of the orthodox canon. The Christ had preached a universal doctrine, a new revelation of the Good God, the
  Father over all. They who tried to graft this on to Judaism, the imperfect creed of one
  smafl nation, were in grievous error, and had totally misunderstood the teaching of the
  Christ. The Christ was not the Messiah promised to the Jews. That Messiah was to be an
  earthly king, was intended for the Jews alone, and had not yet come. Therefore the
  pseudo-historical "in order that it might be fulfilled " school had adulterated
  and garbled the original Sayings of the Lord, the universal glad tidings, by the
  unintelligent and erroneous glosses they had woven into their collections of the
  teachings. It was the most terrific indictment of the cycle of New Testament
  "history" that has ever been formulated. Men were tired of all the
  contradictions and obscurities of the innumerable and mutually destructive variants of the
  traditions concerning the person of Jesus. No man could say what was the truth, now that
  "history" had been so altered to suit the new Messiah-theory of the Jewish
  converts. As to actual history, then, Marcion started with Paul; he was the first who had really
  understood the mission of the Christ, and had rescued the teaching from the obscurantism
  of Jewish sectarianism. Of the manifold versions of the Gospel, he would have the Pauline
  alone. He rejected every other recension, including those now ascribed to Matthew, Mark,
  and John. The Gospel according to Luke, the "follower of Paul," he also
  rejected, regarding it as a recension to suit the views of the Judaising party. His Gospel
  was presumably the collection of Sayings in use among the Pauline churches of his day. Of
  course the Patristic writers say that Marcion mutilated Luke's version; but it is almost
  impossible to believe that, if he did this, so keen a critic as Marcion should have
  retained certain verses which made against his strong anti-Judaistic views. The
  Marcionites, on the contrary, contended that their Gospel was written by Paul from the
  direct tradition, and that Luke had nothing to do with it. But this is also a difficulty,
  for it is highly improbable that Paul wrote any Gospel. So many orthodox apologists wrote against Marcion after his death, that it is possible
  to reconstruct almost the whole of his Gospel. It begins with the public preaching of the
  Christ at Capernaum; it is shorter than the present Luke document, and some writers of
  great ability have held that it was the original of Luke's version, but this is not very
  credible. As for the rest of the documents included in the present collection of the New
  Testament, Marcion would have nothing to do with any of them, except ten of the Letters of
  Paul, parts of which he also rejected as interpolations by the reconciliators of the
  Petro-Pauline controversy. These ten letters were called The Apostle
  ["Apostolikon"]. The longest criticism of Marcion's views is to be found in Tertullian's invective
  Against Marcion, written in 207 and the following years. This has always been regarded by
  the orthodox as a most brilliant piece of work; but by the light of the conclusions
  arrived at by the industry of modern criticism, and also to ordinary common sense, it
  appears but a sorry piece of angry rhetoric. Tertullian tries to show that Marcion taught
  two Gods, the Just and the Good. Marcion, however, taught that the idea of the Jews about
  God, as set forth in the Old Testament, was inferior and antagonistic to the ideal of the
  Good God revealed by the Christ. This he set forth in the usual Gnostic fashion. But we
  can hardly expect a dispassionate treatment of a grave problem, which has only in the last
  few years reached a satisfactory solution in Christendom, from the violent Tertullian,
  whose temper may be gleaned from his angry address to the Marcionites: "Now then, ye
  dogs, whom the apostle puts outside, and who yelp at the God of truth, let us come to your
  various questions! These are the bones of contention, which ye are perpetually gnawing
  !" Enough has now been said to give the reader a general idea of the Marcionite position-
  a very strong one it must be admitted, both because of its simplicity and also because it
  formulated the protest of long slumbering discontent among the outer communities. It is,
  however, difficult to deduce anything like a clear system of cosmogony or christology from
  the onslaughts of the best known haeresiologists on Marcionite doctrines. It has even been
  doubted whether Marcion should be classed as a Gnostic, but this point is set at rest by
  the work of Eznik (Eznig or Esnig), an Armenian bishop, who flourished about 450 A.D. In
  his treatise "The Destruction of False Doctrines", he devotes the fourth and
  last book to the Marcionites, who seem to have been even at that late date a most
  flourishing body. Although it is doubted whether the ideas there described are precisely
  the same as the original system of Marcion, it is evident that the Marcionite tradition
  was of a distinctly Gnostic tendency, and that Marcion owed more to his predecessors in
  Gnosticism than was usully supposed prior to the first translation of Eznik's treatise
  (into French) in 1833. It will be sufficient here to shorten Salmon's summary of this curious Marcionite myth,
  calling the reader's attention to the similarity of parts of its structure to the system
  of Justinus. There were three Heavens; in the highest was the Good God; in the
  intermediate the God of the Law; in the lowest, his Angels. Beneath lay Hyle or
  root-matter. The world was the joint product of the God of the Law and Hyle. The Creative
  Power perceiving that the world was very good, desired to make man to inhabit it. So Hyle
  gave him his body and the Creative Power the breath of hfe, his spirit. And Adam and Eve
  lived in innocence in Paradise, and did not beget children. And the' God of the Law
  desired to take Adam from Hyle and make him serve him alone. So taking him aside, he said:
  "Adam, I am God and beside me there is no other; if thou worshippest any other God
  thou shalt die the death." And Adam on hearing of death was afraid, and withdrew
  himself from Hyle. Now Hyle had been wont to serve Adam; but when she found that he
  withdrew from her, in revenge she filled the world with idolatry, so that men ceased to
  adore the Lord of Creation. Then was the Creator wrath, and as men died he cast them into
  Hell (Hades-the Unseen World), from Adam onwards. But at length the Good God looked down from Heaven, and saw the miseries which man
  suffered through Hyle and the Creator. And He took corn-passion on them, and sent them
  down His Son to deliver them, saying: "Go down, take on Thee the form of a servant [?
  a body], and make Thyself like the sons of the Law. Heal their wounds, give sight to their
  blind, bring their dead to life, perform without reward the greatest miracles of healing;
  then will the God of the Law be jealous and instigate his servants to crucify thee. Then
  go down to Hell, which will open her mouth to receive Thee, supposing Thee to be one of
  the dead. Then liberate the captives Thou shalt find there, and bring them up to Me."
  And thus the souls were freed from Hell and carried up to the Father. Whereupon the God
  of the Law was enraged, and rent his clothes and tore the curtain of his palace, and
  darkened the sun and veiled the world in darkness. Then the Christ descended a second
  time, but now in the glory of His divinity, to plead with the God of the Law. And the God
  of the Law was compelled to acknowledge that he had done wrong in thinking that there was
  no higher power than himself. And the Christ said unto him: "I have a controversy
  with thee, but I will take no other judge between us but thy own law. Is it not written in
  thy law that whoso killeth another shall himself be killed; that whoso sheddeth innocent
  blood shall have his own blood shed? Let me, then, kill thee and shed thy blood, for I am
  innocent and thou hast shed My blood." And then He went on to recount the benefits He had bestowed on the children of the
  Creator, and how He had in return been crucified; and the God of the Law could find no
  defence, and confessed and said: "I was ignorant; I thought Thee but a man, and did
  not know Thee to be a god; take the revenge that is Thy due." And the Christ
  thereupon left him, and betook himself to Paul, and revealed the path of truth. The Marcionites were the most rigid of ascetics, abstaining from marriage, flesh and
  wine, the latter being excluded from their Eucharist. They also rejoiced beyond all other
  sects in the number of their martyrs. The Marcionites have also given us the most ancient
  dated Christian inscription. It was discovered over the doorway of a house in a Syrian
  village, and formerly marked the site of a Marcionite meeting-house or church, which
  curiously enough was called a synagogue. The date is October 1, A.D. 318 and the most
  remarkable point about it is that the church was dedicated to "The Lord and Saviour
  Jesus, the Good - "Chrestos", not Christos. In early times there seems to have
  been much confusion between the two titles. Christos is the Greek for the Hebrew Messiah,
  Anointed, and was the title used by those who believed that Jesus was the Jewish Messiah.
  This was denied, not only by the Marcionites, but also by many of their Gnostic
  predecessors and successors. The title Chrestos was used of one perfected, the holy one,
  the saint; no doubt in later days the orthodox, who subsequently had the sole editing of
  the texts, in pure ignorance changed Chrestos into Christos wherever it occurred; so that
  instead of finding the promise of perfection in the religious history of all the nations,
  they limited it to the Jewish tradition alone, and struck a fatal blow at the universality
  of history and doctrine. There was naturally a number of sub-schools of the Marcion
  school, and in its ranks were a number of distinguished teachers ...
