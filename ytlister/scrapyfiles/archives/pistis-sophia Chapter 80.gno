 Pistis Sophia
translated by G. S. R. MeadMartha again came forward and said: "My Lord, |175. I am sober in my spirit and understand the words which thou sayest. Now, therefore, give me commandment to set forth their solution in openness."And the First Mystery answered and said unto Martha: "I give thee commandment, Martha, to set forth the solution of the words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered in her song."And Martha answered and said: "My Lord, these are the words which thy light-power hath prophesied aforetime through David in the seventh Psalm, saying:"'12. God is a righteous vindicator and strong and long-suffering, who bringeth not on his wrath every day.p. 148Martha interpreteth the words of Sophia from Psalm vii."'13. If ye turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow and made it ready."'14. And he hath made ready for him instruments of death; he hath made his arrows for those who will be burnt up."'15. Behold, injustice hath been in labour, hath conceived wrong and brought forth iniquity."'16. It hath digged a pit and hollowed it out. It will fall into the hole which it hath made."'17. Its wrong will return on its own head, and its injustice will come down on its pate.'"When Martha had said this, the First Mystery which looketh without, said unto her: "Well said, finely, Martha, blessed [one]."Return to the Gnostic Society Library
