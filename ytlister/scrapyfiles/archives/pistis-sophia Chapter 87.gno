 Pistis Sophia
translated by G. S. R. Mead"It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished speaking these words, that Mary Magdalene started forward and said:Mary interpreteth the discourse from the scriptures."My Lord, my indweller of light hath ears and I comprehend every word which thou sayest. Now, therefore, my Lord, on account of the word which thou hast spoken: 'All the souls of the race of men who shall receive the mysteries of the Light, will go into the Inheritance of the Light before all the rulers who will repent, and before those of the whole region of the Right and before the whole region of the Treasury of the Light,'--on account of this word, my Lord, thou hast said unto us aforetime: 'The first will be last and the last will be first,'--that is, the 'last' are the whole race of men which will enter into the Light-kingdom sooner than all those of the region of the Height, who are the first.' On this account, therefore, my Lord, hast thou said unto us: 'Who hath ears to hear, let him hear,'--that is thou desirest to know whether we |198. comprehend every word which thou speakest. This, therefore, is the word, my Lord."It came to pass then, when Mary had finished saying these words, that the Saviour was greatly astonished at the definitions of the words whichp. 167she spake, for she had become pure spirit utterly. Jesus answered again and said unto her: "Well said, spiritual and pure Mary. This is the solution of the word."Return to the Gnostic Society Library
