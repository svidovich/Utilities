     Pistis Sophia: A Gnostic Gospel, pp. xxxix - l. It should be remember 
     that this introduction was written in 1921, decades before the discovery of 
     the Nag Hammadi Library, and at a time when the Pistis Sophia was 
     one of the most important and largest collections of Gnostic material 
     available to scholars.  Note that the complete 1921 edition of 
     Pistis Sophia translated by G.R.S. Mead is now 
     available in our library. by G.R.S. Mead We have in the contents of the Askew, Bruce and Berlin Codices a rich 
     material which hands on to us valuable direct information concerning what I 
     have called 'The Gnosis according to its Friends,' in distinction from what 
     previously used to be our only sources, the polemical writings of the 
     heresiological Fathers, which set forth 'The Gnosis according to its Foes.' 
     We have thus at last a new standpoint from which to review the subject, and 
     therewith the opportunity of revising our impressions in a number of 
     respects; a considerably different angle of vision must needs change the 
     perspective of no little in the picture. The chief business or interest of the orthodox Fathers was to select and 
     stress what appeared to them to be the most bizarre points and elements, 
     all that was most absurd in their judgment, in the many Gnostic systems, 
     and of course, and rightly, everything that could be thought to be 
     ethically reprehensible. Good, bad and indifferent were only too frequently 
     lumped together. It was of no interest to this polemic to mention 
     similarities in belief and practice between the heretics and their 
     opponents, to dwell on the lofty faith of numbers of these Gnostics in the 
     transcendent excellence and overmastering glory of the Savior or on many 
     signs of spiritual inwardness, and especially of high virtue, in which they 
     were at the least not less scrupulous than their critics. Doubtless there 
     were sects and groups whose tenets were absurd at any valuation, and some 
     whose laxity of ethics demanded severe reprobation. But the majority could 
     not be accused on the score of moral delinquency, indeed no few were 
     rigidly ascetic; and some of their speculations again have a sublimity of 
     their own, and in a number of cases anticipated Catholic dogma. If we turn 
     to our direct sources in Coptic translation, we find that the ethic is 
     admirable, even if we are averse from over-asceticism in the religious 
     life, and that their whole-souled devotion to and worship of the Saviour is 
     unbounded. It is no part of the plan of this translation to attempt anything in the 
     nature of a commentary. That would mean a second volume, and would in any 
     case be an unsatisfactory performance; for much would still remain obscure, 
     even if every ray of light shed on this or that special point by those who 
     have most deeply studied the subject, were gathered together. One or two 
     very general remarks, however, may be ventured. u In the P.S. Jesus is everywhere pre-eminent and central. He is here 
     revealed as Saviour and First Mystery, who knows all and unveils all, 
     infinite in compassion. As such he is pre-existent from eternity, and his 
     ministry is not only earthly, but cosmic and supercosmic; indeed, it is the 
     chief feature in the divine economy. Yet nowhere is he called the Christ. 
     If this is intentional, no reason seems to be assignable for such an 
     abstention. There is no sign of antagonism to Judaism or to the O.T. On the 
     contrary, the psalms and other utterances which are quoted, are validated 
     by the theory that it was the Power of the Saviour which 80 prophesied of 
     old through the mouth of a David, a Solomon, or an Isaiah. The whole setting is post-resurrectional. In Div v. i.-iii Jesus has 
     already, for eleven years after the crucifixion, been instructing his 
     disciples, men and women, in the Gnosis. The scene now depicts the 
     disciples as gathered round the Saviour on the Mount of Olives on earth. 
     The range and scope of this prior teaching may be seen in Div. iv., where 
     the introductory words speak of it as taking place simply after the 
     crucifixion. In this stratum the scene is different. The sacramental rite 
     is solemnized on earth; it takes place, however, on the Mount of Galilee 
     and not on the Mount of Olives. But the scene is not confined to earth 
     only, for the disciples are also taken into some of the regions of the 
     invisible world, above and below, have vision there conferred upon them, 
     and are instructed on its meaning. Now in Div v. i.-iii. Jesus promises to 
     take the disciples into the spheres and heavens for the direct showing of 
     the nature and quality and inhabitants, but there is no fulfillment of this 
     promise in the excerpts we have from ' The Books of the savior.' It is not 
     to be supposed, however, that Div. iv. is part of the fulfillment of the 
     high promise made in the prior extracts; for in it we move in an earlier 
     phase of the instruction and in an atmosphere of lesser mysteries than 
     those indicated in the preceding part. Div v. i.-iii. throughout proclaim the revelation of higher mysteries. 
     This is only now made possible by the supremely joyous fact that in the 
     twelfth year of the inner-teaching-ministry a great, If not supreme, moment 
     in the life of the Saviour has been accomplished; his earthly ministry is 
     now achieved, and he is invested with the full radiance of his triple robe 
     of glory, which embraces the whole powers of the universe. He ascends into 
     heaven in dazzling light which blinds the disciples. After thirty hours he 
     returns again, and in compassion withdraws his blinding splendour, 60 as to 
     give his final teaching to his faithful in his familiar form. This means 
     that ' The Books of the Saviour' purport to contain not only a post-resurrectional 
     teaching, and therefore a Gnostic revelation supplementary to the public 
     preaching before the crucifixion, but also a still higher and more intimate 
     unveiling within the post-resurrectional instruction already current in the 
     tradition. If there had been apocalyptic elements and visions in the prior 
     literature, there were to be still more transcendental revelations now on 
     the completion of the ministry. Until the investiture, or rather 
     reinvestiture, had taken place according to the divine command, it had not 
     been possible for the Saviour to speak in utter openness face to face on 
     all things; now it is possible. Such is the convention. In Div v. i.-iii. there is presupposed throughout a system of eons and 
     the rest, which is already highly complex and shows manifest signs of 
     consisting of stage once severally at the summit of earlier systems, but 
     now successively subordinated. It is clear then that, if still loftier 
     hierarchies are to be brought on to the stage, it can only be by again 
     reducing what had previously been regarded as 'the end of all ends ' to a 
     subordinate position. This is the method adopted, and we lose ourselves in 
     the recital of the designations and attributes of ever more transcendental 
     beings and spaces and mysteries. In all of this, however, there is no sign of interest in metaphysical 
     speculation; there is no philosophizing.. It is then not any element of 
     Hellenic thought proper in the aeonology, which is said to have been so 
     strongly the case with the teaching of Valentinus himself, that has led so 
     many to conjecture a Valentinian derivation. It is rather the long episode 
     of the sorrowing Sophia which has influenced them. This episode reflects on 
     a lower level of the cosmic scale somewhat of the motif of the ' tragic 
     myth' of the world-soul the invention of which is generally ascribed to 
     Valentinus himself, though he may possibly have transformed or worked up 
     already existing materials or notions. It is this long Sophia episode and 
     its skillfully inverted mystical exegesis and allegorical interpretation, 
     following the method developed by Alexandrine contemplatives which has 
     produced the impression on many that it was of fundamental importance for 
     the system of the P.S. It is certainly an indication of the deep interest of the circle in 
     repentance and the penitential psalms. But the interest is here ethical 
     rather than cosmological. Pistis Sophia would seem ~o be intended to 
     represent the type of the faithful repentant individual soul. Throughout, 
     the chief interest is in salvation and redemption. This i8 to be acquired 
     by repentance and by renunciation of the world, its lures and cares, but 
     above all by faith in the Saviour, the Divine Light, and his mysteries. The 
     first requisite is sincere repentance. The chief topic round which all the 
     ethical teaching naturally centres, is sin, its cause and its purification, 
     and the revelation of the mystery of the forgiveness of sins and of the 
     infinite compassion of the First Mystery. Though there i8 very much also 
     concerning the complex schematology of the invisible worlds and the 
     hierarchies of being, much concerning the soul and its origin, of how it 
     comes to birth and departs from earth-life, much of the light-power, the 
     spiritual element in man,-all is subordinated to the ethical interest in 
     the first place, and in the second to the efficacy of the high mysteries of 
     salvation. The whole is set forth in terms of these mysteries, which are now 
     conceived in a far more vital way than was apparently the case in the 
     earlier literature. On the lower side the mysteries still in some respects 
     keep in touch with the tradition of words-of-power, authentic and 
     incorruptible names, and so forth, though there is little of this 
     specifically in Div v. i.-iii. But it is evidently intended that the higher 
     mysteries should now be conceived in the light of the fact that the Saviour 
     himself is in himself concretely the First Mystery and indeed the Last 
     Mystery, and that -the mysteries are not so much spiritual powers as 
     substantive beings of transcendent excellence The light-robe is a mystery 
     of mysteries, and they who have received of the high mysteries become 
     light-streams in passing from the body. The mysteries are closely 
     intertwined with the lore of the glory and its modes. One of the main elements in the lower schematology isthe ancient astral 
     lore, those ground-conceptions of sidereal religion which dominated the 
     thought of the times and upheld their sway directly and indirectly for long 
     centuries after. But here again our Gnostic, while retaining the 
     schematology for certain purposes, placed it low in the scale. Moreover, 
     while not denying that previously there was truth even in the astrological 
     art, they reduced the chances of the horoscope-casters to zero, by 
     declaring that the Saviour in the accomplishment of his cosmic ministry had 
     now drastically changed the revolution of the spheres, so that henceforth 
     no calculations could be counted on; these were now of no more value than 
     the spinning of a coin. Our Gnostics were also tranmigrationists ; transcorporation formed an 
     integral part of their system. They found no difficulty in fitting it into 
     their plan of salvation, which show no sign of the expectation of an 
     immediate end of all things -that prime article of faith of the earliest 
     days. So far from thinking that reincarnation is alien to gospel-teaching, 
     they elaborately interpret certain of the most striking sayings in this 
     sense, and give graphic details of how Jesus, as the First Mystery, brought 
     to rebirth the souls of John the Baptizer and of the disciples, and 
     supervised the economy of his own incarnation. In this respect the P.S. 
     offers richer material for those interested in this ancient and widespread 
     doctrine than can be found in any other old-world document in the West. A far more distressingly puzzling immixture is the element of magic. In 
     Div. iv. especially there are invocations and many names which resemble 
     those found in the Greek magical papyri and other scattered sources. But no 
     one has so far thrown any clear light on this most difficult subject of 
     research in general, much less on its relation to the P.S. It is evident 
     that the writers of Div. iv. and of the first treatise of the Bruce Codex 
     set a high value on such formula and on authentic names; nor are these 
     entirely absent from the excerpts from 'The Books of the Saviour' as 
     witness the five words written on the lightrobe. Our Gnostics 
     unquestionably believed in a high magic, and were not averse from finding 
     in what was presumably its most reputable tradition, material which they 
     considered to be germane to their purpose. In this tradition there must 
     have been a supreme personage possessing characteristics that could be 
     brought into close connection with their ideal of the Saviour, for they 
     equate a certain Aberamentho with him. The name occurs once or twice 
     elsewhere; but who or what it suggested, we do not know. In any case, as 
     they utilized and attempted to sublimate so much else which was considered 
     by many in those days to be most venerable, in order that they might the 
     more extend and exalt the glory of the Saviour and take up into it what 
     they considered the best of everything, so did they with what was 
     presumably the highest they could find in the hoary tradition of magical 
     power, which had enjoyed empery for so long in the antique world and still 
     continued to maintain itself even in religio-philosophical circles, where 
     we should, from the modern standpoint, least expect to find it. As to the setting of the narrative,-if we had not such an abundance of 
     instances of pseudohistoric and pseudo-epigraphic scripture-writing, if 
     this were not, so to speak, the commonplace, not only of apocryphal and 
     apocalyptic literature, but also of no little that falls within the borders 
     of canonical sanction, we might be more surprised than we are at the form 
     in which the composers or compilers have framed their work. It is clear 
     that they loved and worshipped Jesus with an ecstasy of devotion and 
     exaltation; they do not fall short in this of the greatest of his lovers. 
     What sort of authority, then, could they have Supposed they had for 
     conceiving the setting of their narrative in the way they have ? Objective physical history, in the rigid sense in which we understand it 
     to-day, was of secondary interest to them, to say the least; indeed, it was 
     apparently of little moment to the Gnostics of any school, and their 
     opponents were not infrequently rowing in the same boat. The Gnostics were, 
     however, less disingenuous; they strenuously declared their belief in 
     continued revelation, they delighted in apocalyptic and in psychic story. 
     The belief in a post-resurrectional teaching had doubtless existed for long 
     in many forms in Gnostic circles. It must have been widespread; for, as 
     shown by Schmidt quite recently (Bib. 59), a (Catholic writer in Asia Minor 
     found himself compelled to steal the fire of the Gnostics and adopt the 
     same convention in an orthodox document that was intended to be a polemic 
     against Gnostic ideas, somewhere in the 3rd quarter of the 2nd century. 
     However they arrived at their conviction, it seems highly probable that the 
     writers of the P.S. must have sincerely believed they had high authority 
     for their proceeding, and were in some way emboldened by ' inspiration ' to 
     carry out their task. As far as they were concerned, they do not by any 
     means seem conscious of belonging to a decadent movement or of 
     deterioration in the quality of the ideas they were attempting to set 
     forth, as so many modern critics would have it. On the contrary, they 
     thought they were depositories or recipients of profound mysteries never 
     hitherto revealed, and that by a knowledge of these mysteries they could 
     the more efficiently evangelize the world. It is evident, however, that the P.S. was never intended to be 
     circulated as a public gospel. Certain things are to be preached or 
     proclaimed to the world, but only certain things. Certain mysteries, again, 
     the recipients were to bestow under certain conditions, but others were to 
     be reserved. The ' Books of the Saviour ' are, therefore, to be regarded as 
     apocrypha in the original sense of the word-that is, ' withdrawn ' or ' 
     reserved ' writings. As such they fell within the proscriptions of 
     artificial secrecy common to all the initiatory institutions of the time 
     and of all time. And artificial secrecy can with difficulty, if ever, avoid 
     the moral and intellectual hazard of its innate obscurations. The P.S. was 
     intended for already initiated disciples, for chosen learners, though ~o 
     pledge of secrecy is mentioned. It was intended, above all, for would-be 
     apostles, for those who should go forth to proclaim what was for them the 
     best of good news; it is clearly the inner instruction of a zealously 
     propagandist sect. If ' The Books of the Saviour ' in their full original form - for in the 
     extant P.S. we have but selections from them and the formula of the higher 
     mysteries are omitted,-and if what is given of the lower mysteries in Div. 
     iv. were held back from public perusal owing partly at least to the fear of 
     the unworthy making improper use of them, there is little danger to-day on 
     this score, for this part of the miscellany remains so far the most 
     securely incomprehensible. And indeed no little else remains obscure, even 
     when we are of those who have made a protracted study of the psychical 
     elements in mysticism and of the general psychology of religious 
     experience. But there is much also in our codex which has a charm of its 
     own. There are things of rare, if exotic, beauty, things of profound 
     ethical significance, things of delicate spiritual texture. In any case, however all these very various elements and features in the 
     syncretism be judged and evaluated, the Pistis Sophia is unquestionably a 
     document of the first importance, not only for the history of Christianized 
     Gnosticism, but also for the history of the development of religion in the 
     West.
